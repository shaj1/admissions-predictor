ECs are what got me in for sure. I don't have a flawless record and that's not what you should be telling your kids to spend their time on. Tell your kids to find something they love to do and follow it. Every EC doesn't have to be a leadership position in a club or an award related to academics. They want to see passion outside of the realm of academia.
Strengths: ECs and GPA

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I think I was admitted early because (like I emphasized in my essays) I think I did what I enjoyed, even if it was different. I hosted many local, regional, and a state competition for VEX robotics with an old advisor my Sunior and Senior year, which was a huge commitment, but I did because I loved it. I think that set me apart from a lot of students who simply put ""Robotics Competitor."" I did lead my team to Worlds in Kentucky my Freshman year.

Personal Insight essays (details):
In the leadership essay talked about my leadership experience as a section leader what I gained from it as well as how this was applicable to wanting to study brain science. Another essay (educational opportunity) talked about my experience in my school’s e-STEM program in which catered to my interest in the medical field more and allowed me to do a research project. In the talent essay, I talked about my ability to communicate with other people how it’s allowed to build relationship with a variety of people from my school. I also related that to how it’s allowed to gain leadership positions and volunteer positions and stuff like that while adding a bit more of how it related neuroscience, psychology, and how we think and all that. In my last essay(passion), I talked about my absolute passion for neurobiology and I even gave it a theme around different brain concepts I was interested in. overall, that’s pretty much it. I felt my essays arched over the different themes in my life but they all tied into what I wanted to study somehow. So perhaps this is a good strategy

General Comments:
Made an account just to post here! Very happy to at least be accepted somewhere out of state. My advice to rising juniors is to apply based on where you think you'll fit best, but also, don't limit yourself! You can't predict where you'll get in; at the start of application season, I would've told you I thought I had a better chance of getting into any one of the three schools I got rejected from than Berkeley, and look how that worked out.

Reflection:
Strengths: Wrote about experiences that truly resonated with me
Weaknesses: Scores
Thoughts: While scores are important for college, it is important to consider what classes will allow you to learn the most and think on a deeper level. The perfect 4.0 is not the end all be all. Essays are important to show the college what you are passionate, what makes you tick. Basically, don't write about what you think the college wants to read about, write from the heart and know that even if you get 20 rejections (or rejected from all the other UCs lol), you will end up where you are meant to be. Good luck:) ",Berkeley,2023

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: My art essay was really unique, my other essays were unique, passionate, and geeky as well. My main weakness was my french grades which destroyed my GPA, but ECs, course rigor, strong grades in other classes made up for it.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected:
accepted at UIUC (engineering), Purdue (engineering), UWashington (engineering), UCD, UCSB, UCI, Cal Poly SLO (engineering), SJSU (engineering)
waitlisted at UCSD (engineering) and UCSC.
rejected at UCLA (engineering)
General Comments: Didn't apply to privates/anywhere that needed a secondary school report because I get no aid. Don't be afraid to do what I did as if you wouldn't go to a school even if you get accepted, then don't apply. I saved a lot of time and money, and that extra time I used to polish essays.

My daughter is one of ""The 2000"" (sounds like a TV show) who got her letter today, with virtual confetti streaming down the screen, but linked from an ominous email that initially frightened her. Anyway, it's her first letter from ANY college (since she didn't have her act together for ED/EA timeframe), so we are extremely excited and relieved that she will be heading to a four-year college.

Actively seek new challenges that you can overcome, because this is the only way you can develop character and improve yourself. Get out of your comfort zone and keep an open mind about meeting, learning, helping, and forming relationships with a broad amount of people. Also live by your priorities, values, and goals.

AP (place score in parenthesis): World History (5), Chemistry (5), US History (5), Biology (5), Calculus AB (5), Language (5)
IB (place score in parenthesis): lel nope
Senior Year Course Load: Speech and Debate, AP Gov/Macro, Advanced Choir, AP Physics 1, AP Spanish Language & Culture, AP Literature, AP Calculus BC
Major Awards (USAMO, Intel etc.): Nothing really, couple of debate honors
I was a Posse scholar finalist for Middlebury College (turned down the offer though because Middlebury doesn't offer engineering). UhHhhH like AP Scholar w/ Distinction, National Merit Commended Scholar, really quite minor things
Subjective:
Extracurriculars (place leadership in parenthesis): Speech and Debate, Aristocracy - Advanced Choir (Librarian, Secretary, Alto Section Leader), Church Servant Team, Freshman Focus - we basically helped freshman assimilate to high school, organized orientation, Frosh/Soph Basketball lol (Captain), oh yeah and I did research on the concentration of an enzyme in fruit flies
Job/Work Experience: I worked at a boba shop for a summer.
Volunteer/Community service: Got to go to Taiwan last summer and volunteer as an English teacher there at an underprivileged school, California Scholarship Federation (Technology Coordinator, Treasurer), Hospital Volunteer (I play piano), National Honor Society, Helped at a local science academy
Personal Statement: uHhHh soOOOoo I don't think mine were particularly spectacular, but I do think they showed my different life experiences and my love for STEM (also cause Berkeley engineering asked for it to be v engineering and interest focused)
Educational Opportunity: Wrote about research with fruit flies and how that inspired me further to pursue science, even if it wasn't bio; I'd give it about a 7/10--it definitely was my least favorite.
Challenges: I don't live with my dad because of his job, but I wrote about how STEM (my dad's a materials engineer) reduced the distance; oh this one was p good I'd give it 9/10
Community Service: Wrote about my experience in Taiwan. Extremely humbling. 8/10
What Makes You Unique: LMAO i wrote about how much I loved the Boeing 787 even though I hate flights, it's a terribly confusing essay but if you can get my point it's not TOO bad; 6.5/10

Hooks (URM, first generation college, research, etc.): I did research
Reflection
Strengths: Scores. UCs really value the numbers.
Weaknesses: ECs could have been a lot stronger, especially in the realm of leadership.
Schools were you accepted/waitlisted to? UCSB (regents), UCD (regents), Cal Poly SLO (they offered me the opportunity to apply for the LOOP Scholarship but I don't plan on going to SLO in the fall so), UCSD (full ride jacobs scholarship + regents)
Schools you were rejected from? None yet! MIT deferred me though lmao
Schools you are waiting for? MIT, Georgia Tech (oo that comes out tomorrow), CalTech, Stanford (lel a girl can dream), UCLA, Northwestern, USC (didn't get merit scholarship), and Rice!
General Comments: Like what I said in the beginning, don't freak out. You don't need to be a state champ in viola or debate or whatever to get into college. Just do what you love (for me that was choir, science, and debate) and challenge yourself. People you don't think ""deserve"" to get into certain colleges will get in, and people you think ""deserved"" to get into others won't. It happens. For the younger kiddos, do your best to perfect everything in your control, that is GPA, SAT, participation in ECs. If you've put in your utmost effort, then you just leave it up to chance.
Also, finally, from my experience, I've learned that you should favor experiences that aren't academic, especially if you have strong scores already. You do an internship? Math club? Science Olympiad? Acadec? Those are great things, but go outside of your comfort zone and do something that you can write about without sounding like all you do is school-related stuff.
It gives you stuff to write about.
sorry i wrote too much just skip over it if ur bored ",Berkeley,2021

Summer Activities: Relaxing, reading.
Essays (rating 1-10, details): 8; My essays were solid and very heavily edited by a friend of mine who is very good at writing. She will be attending Midd. The focus was my passion for learning, both from my grandfather, who taught me how to fish, and by myself. I focused an essay on my passion for physics.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): I did not read the recs written for me, so most of this is speculation.

Reflection
Strengths: Test scores are my strong suit. I have a natural aptitude for taking standardized tests. I was finished in half the time on both the SAT I math and the Math II test. I did the ACT without a calculator. Tests are my cup of tea. My recs were also good, and because my father is a well known/loved teacher, I got brownie points. My essays were solid and focused on what colleges want to hear: my passion for learning.
Weaknesses: My GPA. Freshman and Sophomore year, I was a slacker. My grades were much better Junior and Senior year. My math grades were also weak until senior year, which is ironically when I started my hardest math course yet. My lack of meaningful ECs and major awards is also a weakness.
Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: A whole lot of natural ability got me into the position to do the Hard work that got me considered. Good luck got me selected. You need a fair amount of all three or an insane amount of two to succeed.
Where else were you accepted/deferred/rejected:
Accepted: UIUC, UCSB, UVA, VTech, W&M, Cornell.
Rejected: Caltech, MIT, UChicago (deferred from EA, then rejected).

Summer Activities: some listed above, and if there were a short essay about my summer, I would have written “spent hours perfecting my serve.”
Essays (rating 1-10, details):
#1: I wrote about how my curiosities dominate my life, and basically used debate and tennis as examples of how the question ""why"" influences me. It's very logical, and I tried to reflect my personality as a realistic, concise person.
#2: Love about history and how I hypothesize different scenarios and make comparisons throughout time periods
#3: My experience as a military child and how it has affected me (sent to almost all colleges)
#4: Why I ran for student council, my love for government, and how I want to expand the idea that local government is the most important.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: 7 – APUSH teacher. Great letter. We’re really close, and it showed. I read the letter and it included an anecdote. However, I think the letter might be a little undeveloped. It praises me, but a little more ""tell"" than ""show."" However, it is around 700 words.
Teacher Rec #2: 5 – AP Chem / AP Physics teacher. I read it just yesterday. A lot ""tell"" than ""show."" It's average.
Counselor Rec: 4 – We are close, but her writing doesn't show much. It regurgitates parts of my resume and doesn't add much.

[ /list][ b]General Comments:[ /b] Is it just me or does it seem like UCLA is harder to get into than Berkeley? At my high school in particular it is common to have 5-10 Berkeley admits a year and only 1-2 UCLA. This has been a pattern in past years, not just this one. ",Berkeley,2021
100,"
@WafflePeak idk if it's harder to get in to UCLA over Berkeley since both look at different criteria? Berkeley has been known for its holistic review as stated by many other users and Berkeley themselves. Perhaps UCLA looks more at test scores and academics. Berkeley's holistic review could be the reason for more admits from your school. My school has the same trend. Around 11 people were accepted to UCLA and around 17 people were accepted to UCB from my school. ",Berkeley,2021
101,"
From my school, people who are accepted into both LA and Berk are rare. However, those who are accepted into both get a regents invitation from LA or Berk (or both). Therefore, I can heavily speculate that both LA and Berk coordinate admissions to some extent unless BOTH schools want you (like receiving a regents or chancellors invite). For example, I have four friends who got into Berk early this year with regents invite; on the day of UCLA decision release day, UCLA called them and asked them how likely they were to attend. For our high school, we prefer Berk to LA: even if we get regents at LA and don't get regents at Berk, we go to Berk. ",Berkeley,2021

@16to17journey Yeah I feel like there may be some coordination going on too. I only know one person who got into both UCLA and UC Berkeley, but she didn't get regents from either ",Berkeley,2021

General comments:
I just posted this to give hope to all those prospective students, especially with a school as competitive as Berkeley Engineering. To be honest, I never thought I'd get in. (I was betting on Michigan and ironically, did not get in even though the acceptance rate is way bigger and the average GPA is lower.) I'm like that artsy kid with zero engineering experience, zero awards or research experience, and average test scores (especially for math) and some how got in. In my essays I wrote about ballet and tutoring, and refurbishing furniture. I literally completed the app within the two days before it was due and I didn't even mention my interest in engineering despite being encouraged to on the UC app.
The point is, you never know what will happen these days, so expect the unexpected! I'm deciding between Vassar and Cal now, the first of which I applied ten days late to and the other of which I only applied to because I thought I might as well take advantage of my ELC status. I never expected to go to either. You will probably put in way more work than necessary and stress out about the most stupid of things. Just, at the end of the day, remember it will turn out okay. You will make it through and everything happens for a reason. Good luck!  ",Berkeley,2021

Go to Barnard College of Columbia University!! It's an undergraduate college of Columbia U but still has that liberal arts vibe. Best of both worlds. Plus, it's in NYC. So many internship opportunities. Acceptance rate is 14.8%, gets lower each year as more people find out about it. Such a unique school. ",Berkeley,2021

But what I will say is that the college admissions process is both a crapshoot and a testament to your hard work and will to make your dreams come to fruition. Don't think of yourself as just a sum of your scores or GPA because you are WAY more than that. Just focus on the things you can control, believe in yourself, and have faith that everything will work out the way that it's meant to. GO BEARS!!!!  ",Berkeley,2021

Personal Statement: I poured my soul into my essays, and I honestly think they are the only reason I got in--especially early with Regents invite. I was initially pretty nervous about them, because I went a more creative route despite what I've heard about how the UC's want a more straightforward personal statement. So maybe if you have an unusual idea that you're passionate about, go for the risk and be creative...?

General Comments:
TO FUTURE APPLICANTS: In high school, I didn't do the things high-achieving kids were expected to do at my school. I didn't participate in the full IB Diploma program, didn't join our Constitution Team, didn't join any community service clubs, didn't join the International Study Center, didn't join National Honor Society, didn't even take that many IB classes my junior or senior years because I simply didn't want to spend that much time and effort on a subject I wasn't all that interested in. This meant I had a ton of free time that I got to spend on working on the things I loved--math and writing.
DO WHAT YOU LOVE. High school is about so much more than doing things to get into college. Pursue the things you're interested in. That way, no matter the outcome, it would have been worth it.  ",Berkeley,2020

General Comments: Look at the people above me. They are so much more awesome compared to me. I am literally surprised I was admitted early at all since I am average based on Berkeley's standards, especially when you look at my complete failure to pass Math and Science parts of exams hahahaha but luckily I got into Letters and Science and will be having some fun working towards either social welfare, social work, or public policy. I also did not get a Regents invite but it's no big deal to me since I will be applying to other scholarships and my EFC is manageable. Basically, I say pour your heart out into your essays - my essay about coming out was very emotional to write and I really hope they enjoyed reading it - and DO NOT STRESS ABOUT EXAMS. I got in with a SAT 1980 and ACT 31, and I saw someone with way higher scores who did not get in yesterday. It's all about the final package. ",Berkeley,2020

ACT: 34 superscore (35E 34M 33R 32S 36W), 33 one sitting (31S) (Yet again, science is another one of my strongest academic subjects)
SAT II: 790 Math 2, 650 Chemistry
-LOL let's not talk about the Chem. score. I had only taken two months of AP Chemistry, and regular Chemistry does not teach you enough, so this was merely due to a lack of knowledge. I got an A first semester, and I am doing fine in AP Chem. right now with an A+ after two tests and several quizzes. And no, my teacher isn't easy.

General Comments: It never hurts to apply. Seriously. The admissions officers look for something different depending on the major, so it's never so clear cut if you'll be accepted or not. I was as truthful as possible on my application, because I wanted them to view me for who I really was, and that's what they always want to see. Plus, think of it as a blessing in disguise; they'll know if you, as a person and not just a set of test scores, will be a good fit for the school and have an enriching experience there.

General Comments: I applied to other safeties, but now don't have to worry about them because I'm into Berkeley!!! Tbh the most important part of the college process other than grades and test scores are your personal statements. Obviously for some it's too late, but if you didn't get in last Friday, rest assured that if you wrote good essays, they count for a lot in the process. Also, you definitely don't need tutoring for the SAT, like 95% of my school. Just use the blue book, and learn from your mistakes, and save some cash for something else. Good luck!!! ",Berkeley,2020

Reflection
Yes!! 5 for 5!! Probably won't be attending Berkeley in favor of UChicago, but either way, still extremely happy with the way the college admissions process worked out.
To prospective applicants looking to getting into the top colleges, I have to say this. College admissions is a game, and you have to play it to your advantage. Admissions officers are looking for individuality, specialization, uniqueness. Essentially, try to be the most memorable, interesting person possible. Don't conform to standard extracurriculars if you feel you have to. Pursue the oddities and reveal your eccentricities.
Strengths: GPA, Course rigor,
What you tried to focus on in your application - any hooks you tried to make for yourself: Music oriented, composing

General Comments: I'm making this post in order to help those applying to college. I know I looked at these posts often and I really appreciated the people who had some good advice. Hopefully I have some wisdom to impart from my experiences as well. Make sure you start your essays early. I always wanted to go to Cal. So, I spent the most time on my UC essays. Work with your friends on your essays. Have them help you as you help them. I honestly think the essays are the most crucial part of the application. I've seen people get rejected with great scores and I've seen people get accepted with not so great scores. The essays, in my opinion, can make that difference. Try to have something unique in your essay, that shows who you are are and your genuine interests. Lastly, if you don't get into your dream school, as cliche as it is, life always has a better school waiting for you. You just don't know it yet. Good Luck to all you future applicants!!

I've been having the best of luck with getting into these universities and all I can say to that is that.. there is a God! Like seriously, that's my only explanation. I'm in shock. Didn't see any of this happening. Good luck to everyone and future applicants!

Comments:
For some reason, I was not admitted regularly to UCB, I got some weird ""enrollment path"" thing, previously known as spring admission, which means I can't take regular UCB courses until spring, though I can take classes (from a very limited selection) in fall in the 'fall program for freshman' through Extension. I'm not really sure why some people get this (is it random, is it for borderline applicants? over-represented groups?) I'm posting my stats in case others are curious about the stats of people who got this strange admission. ",Berkeley,2019

General Comments:
Like I said before, this website is absolute evil. It makes you compare yourself to others, lowers your self-esteem and honestly makes life a little bit (A LOT) crappier. But hey, I spent wayyyyyy to much time on this website so I would feel guilty if didn’t post. So because I am compromising my principles by posting on this website, I feel like I should share the immense amount of wisdom I have gained over the past couple of months. Instead of trying to analyze my stats and figure out how the hell I got in (or didn’t get in), here are some things to take away from this is: 1) Do not compare yourself or try to copy others. It is human nature but try to remember that everyone is unique 2) please don’t try to look for some pattern on these stat threads. Trust me. I tried, I failed, don’t waste your time. 3) You may think that some people on this website who are rejected/accepted are gods who can walk on water but...dramatic pause… it is all an illusion (GASP). What you see on these stats are people in their best light with all their flaws excluded. I mean looking now at my stats, I am quite impressed but if you met me in person, haha, that would be a different story 4) You probably won’t believe me now but no matter how good the acceptance feels or how **** that rejection feels, you won’t remember it a couple months down the road. For those who were rejected, just remember this, you can't mourn a fate that isn't yours. You WILL end up in a place that is right for you, a place that will make you happy. So even though you may think I am just spouting out a bunch of ****, all I ask for is to give me the benefit of the doubt.
Wow that was a lot. If you made it to the end, AWESOME! I hope I was able to enlighten you. So, in summation, be yourself, like the number pi there is no pattern, unlike what you may see on this website none of us are perfect, give me the benefit of the doubt and in the words of Stanley Fich, have fun, be safe, and party hard.

With high test scores and applying to good universities where Aff.Action is against you, it's the passion and what you can contribute to the campus that they care about. It's sketch but yeah, different schools give more importance to different parts of the application. Excel or try to excel at one subject/activity that interests you, but explore other things and if they interest you, spend time on those too. Doing things just for college never hurts  but, in my experience, colleges prefer the ""king of the trade"", rather than the ""jack of all trades"" encouraged by the ""well-rounded"" notion. Yet some evidence of other interests and expressing diversity in some form is necessary. From my results, it's pretty obvious that each college is different. ",Berkeley,2019

UC (and CSU) GPA is calculated as described here: https://secure.csumentor.edu/planning/high_school/gpa_calculator.asp
In practice, a student who took at least 8 semesters of 10th-11th grade courses eligible for +1 honors points will have a UC GPA that is about 0.3 to 0.4 higher than the unweighted 10th-11th grade courses. UC admissions readers will also see unweighted and weighted (using the UC weightings, not your high school's weightings) without the 8 semester limits GPA.

Income Bracket: Middle class


Probably 90% of the people will say ""middle class""...
A better way would just be to say whether one's family income is higher or lower than the median for households headed by someone age 45-54 (typical age for parents of high school and college students). This was $66,411 per year in 2012, according to http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/data/historical/household/2012/H10AR_2012.xls .

Why you think you were accepted/wait listed/denied: No clue... I would be skeptical of myself if I were an admissions officer. Lucky for them they made the right decision and I will most likely be attending and representing Berkeley in my hopefully illustrious career as a mathematician.
Other Factors: Hope my parents can pay for UCB. If I go I will be starting in the 100s in the math department, which leaves ample time for grad courses and hopefully time to develop a meaningful relationship with some of the great mathematicians at Berkeley.

BE YOURSELF. Don't be shy and be open about your struggles . Honestly, the admission officers do not know how much we struggled in our lives nor about our personalities until we tell them.

Why you think you were accepted?
I think I was accepted because of my personal statements and GPA. My personal statements were just that, personal. In fact, I bawled my eyes out when I was writing my second one about my younger brother. I felt like I was relieving a huge weight on my shoulders, being able to be honest and to tell my life's story. As far as my GPA goes, I think it being a perfect 4.0, compliments well with my class rigor when you consider that my school only offers 10 AP classes and 19 Honors classes. My extracurriculars are all over the place, but they do show a lot of innovation. Instead of seizing opportunities, I created opportunities for myself, as well as for others. I spent a lot of time trying my best to make a change at my school, and I believe that it's another form of leadership in itself.

General Comments:
I honestly don't know what to say. A lot of people had their doubts about me being accepted into Cal, and I did too. I'm so thrilled and happy, because I fell in love with this school when I stayed for 10 days during the summer for a program. It was inspiring and motivated me to start up things and make a change in school! I'm excited now to be able to return. But to those who have doubts, because you have a low test score, well... Anything can happen! Trust in yourself and write a darn good essay! Do things to make up for your weaknesses! And just be honest! And for those who might be wondering why I applied and got rejected from so many private universities, is because I applied under QuestBridge. My QuestBridge application and Common App essays were not as well done and written as my Personal Statements for the UCs. So as you can see, a good essay comes a long way. Good luck to next year's applicant pool! FIAT LUX! ",Berkeley,2018

Did you get enough scholarships and financial aid? UC normal financial aid (in the absence of merit scholarships) does not cover the $23,000 out-of-state additional tuition. ",Berkeley,2018
245,"
@ucbalumnus
When I pulled up my financial aid, they gave me something labeled ""Conditional Undergraduate Scholarship"" that amounted to about $15,598, and I'm assuming that that's a need-based scholarship and not a merit one. Originally, the amount given was higher when they had me under ""Living in Dorms,"" but when I switched to ""Living with Relatives"" (I'll be staying with my aunt who lives about 30-35 minutes away from the campus), the price dropped to that. I also want to note that UCB is also missing my parents' tax returns for 2013, so I'm assuming anything given to me from the Office of Financial Aid could fluctuate up or down once I turn it in. So I believe that nothing is completely finalized yet.
Luckily, my aunts and uncles are very supportive of me going all the way out to Cal (I'm the oldest, most hard-working one, amongst my cousins, and being that my mother was the oldest and had to work to finance her siblings' education after they immigrated due to the Vietnam War, I feel as though they're returning the favor hahaha), so they're all pitching in some money to help pay for the tuition and costs.
But they stated that the expected Family Contribution is $14,400, and then I guess the rest are... Loans. Loans. Loans. Currently, I'm looking into and possibly applying to outside scholarships given out by various companies and corporations. And of course downgrade on the little things, such as find used books or maybe a smaller meal plan (if that's possible). I'll also probably be doing some work-study also, as well as look into state residency, but I've heard that there is some difficulty (if not close to impossible) in doing that. So we'll have to see. But regardless of all of that, gotta save save save!
While we're at it, any advice at all on earning state residency or anything at all on helping with the cost? Please and thank you! ",Berkeley,2018

Major Awards (USAMO, Intel etc.): AP Scholar w/ Distinction, National Merit Finalist (I might have only written ""Semifinalist"" on the app because I hadn't yet gotten notification of my finalist status.)
Subjective:
Extracurriculars (place leadership in parenthesis): 6 years of guitar, 1 year of drums/percussion, ""Unpopular"" Music Club - for ppl with a taste in music better known by our parents than by our own generation (Founder and President), Robotics Club, Science club (Co-founder and Co-president), Philosophy Club (Secretary)
Job/Work Experience: lined soccer fields over past 3-4 years
Volunteer/Community service: unpaid internship teaching drums and guitar to children in the local area
Summer Activities: many things (reading, traveling, summer homework, songwriting, et al.), but none of which I described on my application
Essays: I wrote two very PASSIONATE (this is the #1 thing the Cal AdComs care about) essays. The 1st was about how playing the guitar has made helped me conquer my fear of social judgment (I'm still an introvert, but now I perform my songs for people and am outspoken about my political beliefs which JUST HAPPEN to be pretty far on the left; don't get the impression that there aren't any rightists at Berkeley, because they make up a significant minority. I'm sure there are even a few Fascists since the campus is so diverse, not just racially or sexually but also ideologically.) ANYWAY, my 2nd essay was about how my AP Chem teacher hardly gave any instructions in labs and why I therefore had to figure things out on my own and stay hours after school each week troubleshooting. The message here - which I implied through this story, but did not explicitly state - was that I am a very perseverant and creative (because of all the things I tried w/ the troubleshooting) person. And, of course, I also wanted to convey that I was interested in and prepared for Cal's rigorous chem program.
Teacher Recommendation: N/A
Counselor Rec: N/A
Additional Rec: N/A
Interview: Regents' Scholarship: I think it went very well. My interviewer was genuinely interested in my activities and definitely saw that I was eager to attend Berkeley and to study chem and play music. By the way, she told me that I'd been accepted at the beginning of the interview, which is true for all prospective Regents' scholars; this is how I found out what the decision was ahead of the regular notification date.
Other
State (if domestic applicant): CA
School Type: Public, ~1600 students
Ethnicity: White (Because I'm maternally Spanish and identify with that culture more than with my paternal British ancestry, I self-identified as ""Hispanic"" on the application. However, the UC system is not supposed to take race/sex into consideration for admissions decisions; I believe they only use this for statistical analysis.)
Gender: Male
Income Bracket: ~150,000 because both my parents work 10+ hours a day and essentially get paid according to how much work they get done (they both work in insurance inspection)
Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): Nothing, really. Both my parents got BA's. I'm not a first-generation college student, but I am the first person in my immediately family (as well as all known relatives more closely related than third cousins) either to seriously play a musical instrument or to choose a major in the hard sciences. Aside from that, as I already mentioned, I'm on the far left, but I didn't explicitly say that on my application. I wouldn't recommend getting political on your application, either (I'm addressing next year's prospective applicants now) because you never know what biases the person(s) who read(s) your app will have.
Reflection
Strengths: GPA, SAT, passionate, well-written essays
Weaknesses: didn't have any unusual activities (unless you count the school club I started for ppl interested in non-mainstream music), and, clearly, I could have gotten more awards
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: because I've got a lot of individuality and am passionate about my major as well as interests outside of it (i.e. I'm a good fit for Cal)
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Accepted to UCSD and UCD, rejected from MIT. Once I hear from about half a dozen private universities in a couple weeks, I'll update this list.
General Comments: If there were an ideal example of someone who easily made it into Berkeley without doing much volunteering, that example would be me. I know people who applied to Berkeley who have 300+ hours of volunteering (which is a problem, because the people I'm referring to don't actually enjoy the volunteering they do; if they did it for their own edification, it would be a different story). Their volunteering activities evacuated all the free time to do things they actually loved out of their schedules, and their grades suffered as well. My recommendation is that you find something you're already passionate about and come up with a way to use that to benefit your community (like I do by teaching new musicians in my hometown to play the guitar and drums). It will look more meaningful on your application and will fit better into your schedule/life than will hundreds of hours of heterogeneous occupations. The latter can only make you appear to be undecided about who you are as a person and what you enjoy. From an existentialist perspective this is perfectly fine, but when it comes to college applications, you should at least make it SEEM like you have an idea of what your future will be. Yeah, I said it: college applications force you to simplify the most complicated and beautiful aspect of your existence, i.e. your journey to self-discovery. Unfortunately, that's the way the system works. Anyway, I hope all this info was useful and that I didn't waste your time. ",Berkeley,2016

Why is emphasizing GPA over SAT necessarily bad? This study indicates that high school GPA is more predictive of college grades than SAT scores are.
Berkeley admissions is holistic, but the process is designed for consistency and scalability, rather than such goals as ""building a class of unique students"" that some highly selective private schools are said to emphasize. See the Hout report. ",Berkeley,2016
279,"
GPA depends on what school you are coming from. It's hard to get Good GPA from very competitive school. The right way for the admission process is to count both SAT/ACT score and GPA together along with ECs/Essay. But than the admission will be very predictable and more merit based.Than there won't be fun part in the admission process !!!!. That's why there is a whole "" holistic "" approach . ",Berkeley,2016

Weaknesses: Lack of return on investment for EC's, some within and some way out of my control.
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I really don't know, with Regents to Davis I was expecting to get in at Berkeley. Guess my essays weren't quite enough somehow, or something random they didn't want. EC accomplishments should've been better. Too bad I get injured easy and cannot control changing band teachers every year.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Accepted to Cal Poly SLO Engineering, Regents to UC Davis and UCSB both.

abscalc: Yes, you only live in dorms for the first year or two. I thought that was strange when I started, but it actually makes sense. Nobody wants to live in dorms past the first 2 years - apartments are much bigger, cheaper, and you get your own kitchen and bathroom. There's a lot of nice apartments available right by campus, so finding one is never an issue.
I lived in dorms for the first two years and loved it, met a ton of people. Moved to a gorgeous house with 3 others the third year, which was located closer to campus buildings than a lot of the dorms. It works out well, so don't worry about it. ",Berkeley,2016

I am extremely grateful that Berkeley's Admission counselors saw past my SAT scores, & it just shows that SAT scores aren't everything. I applied undeclared and was accepted to the College of Letters & science and got in for the Fall semester 2012. To any future discouraged College confidentialers out there who have low SAT scores, I encourage you to apply wherever your heart desires although the statistics are dim and daunting. Just pour your heart and soul into your application and good things will come. Just keep positive. & if it doesn't work out, just know you tried your hardest and you're bound to end up somewhere good!

Reflection
Strengths: Essays, definitely. Showed what I wanted, why I was passionate about, and what I planned on doing with what I learned. Also, since I knew what I wanted to study, I was able to take classes in these subjects. Since I wanted to major in anthropology, I was able to take classes at the local JC in history, religion, and an actual anthropology class.
Weaknesses: SAT scores, I guess? I thought I did pretty well until I started reading CC. Apparently most people here would DIE if they got less than 2200 on the SAT. Also, the fact that my school doesn't offer APs, and while it's obvious its classes are on the level of APs, I was worried because there were so many applicants they wouldn't care enough to research this.
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected:
I was strong in the subject I wanted to major in (Anthropology). If I applied for something in a math field, I definitely wouldn't get in. I was probably deferred till spring because my stats (GPA, SAT) weren't amazing compared to others.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected:
Accepted: SF State, University of Oregon, UBC Okanagan, UBC Vancouver, UC Santa Cruz
Waitlisted: UCLA, Oberlin, Reed
Rejected: Columbia, Barnard
Still waiting for Claremont McKenna
General Comments:
Well, this was definitely a pleasant surprise! I know how hard it is to get in, especially these last 3 years, but I did it and I'm so happy. My friend with much higher stats got rejected, so I feel extremely lucky I did whatever it took to be accepted.
The deferment till Spring 2012 acceptance was a surprise and a bit confusing at first, but I just feel so happy I made it, I don't care. And in retrospect, this is a great opportunity for me. I can take JC classes in the mean time, save money for CAL tuition, and visit my best friend at her college a lot. It might get kind of annoying waiting for spring to come and get out of my town, but, economically at least, this is a great blessing.
I've wanted this since I knew what college was, so this is amazing. I'm still waiting for Claremont McKenna and if I get in, depending on the financial aid package I might go there. Also, UBC Vancouver is definitely tempting. But more than likely, I will choose CAL for their amazing anthropology department. ",Berkeley,2016

don't laugh at my stats, ahhh!! i was rejected from every UC campus I applied to (UCLA, UCSD, UCI), so I wanted to post my stats here to give other future applicants hope! hehe. BTW, i received an additional supplement form from UCB a few months back  if that helpsObjective:
SAT I (breakdown): 800 crit reading, 590 math, 590 grammar, total 1980

Job/Work Experience: Worked on and off since the summer of my sophomore year, mostly during summer.
Volunteer/Community service: local community organizations
Summer Activities: youth job programs!
Essays: Ultimately, my essays are probably what got me accepted. I wrote about an experience I had confronting a City Councilmember about my community's issues at a dinner party I was attending, where he was a keynote speaker for the event! I also wrote about my 4 years of participation in youth community activism/organizing and my struggle in getting my friends to understand the social issues I was passionate about, and getting people to care about issues that, although seemingly inherent in a working class community, is something we can all do something about. SO i think I came across as passionate in my essays?? hehe. My second essay was about me wanting to become a lawyer because i've seen first hand how it can promote social justice, and also because I knew what kind of job I felt was ideal for me, based on my past job experiences throughout high school.
Teacher Recommendation:

Additional Rec: In my additional supplement, I didn't have a teacher or my counselor write my recommendation, but my executive director of the youth community organizing group I was a part of, because she has seen first hand my leadership potential, throughout my entire four years. Just wanted to put that out there for people who think their teachers or their counselor don't know them well enough, and wants someone else to write their rec.

After like 7 ivy league rejections in a row, an acceptance from Berkeley felt so sweet. I was at McDonald's with my friends and, when I saw the decision letter on my phone, I literally jumped up from my chair yelling ""F*** YEA BERKELEY!! I AM DONE WITH HIGH SCHOOL!!! I AM SATISFIED!!"" while kicking the chair next to me. There were a bunch of cholos next to my table and they looked at me like what's wrong with that guy? Hahaha.

anyway congrats to everyone else that got in.
P.s. I hope you people who got like 2200+ on your SATs don't go to cal. less competition for me. LOl jk  hope to see you all here
p.p.s to you high school juniors: if you really want to get into the ivies make sure to do LOTS OF VOLUNTEERING AT ONE PLACE. And I stress AT ONE PLACE. don't go all over the state doing random stuff. Also don't go on one of those ""go to afreaka and i build houses herp derp"" trips. no one likes those.
Also make sure to get LEADERSHIP positions and WRITE ABOUT THEM on your college essay. they like leaders. a lot.
Also try to win major state awards. always a plus.
Last, keep your GPA high, don't get a 2400 on your SAT (cuz they will think you're a nerd), and get a good class rank. easier said than done,but always try.

General Comments/Congratulations/Venting/Commiserations,etc: There are quite a few other bright students at my school. 2300+ SATS, extracurrics like tennis club and spanish club, etc....I was lacking in EC's, i joined absolutely no clubs, and i would rate my scores 92/100 compared to other top students at my school.
I think my assets were grades and possibly my essays. My SAT score was great but not berkeley-definite material, but my grade reports show improvement in grades. I had 2 B's in my whole high school career, but 1 of them was in a famously hard class at my school--AP Bio--and I improved to an A second semester.
My essays--I think it helps that I'm a science major...but I have an interest in the humanities, such as drama and theater and writing.
I'm Asian, yes, but I'm Vietnamese, a smaller Berkeley minority. That might have helped? =O
Anyways, I was so confused/happy/thrilled when I found out I was admitted, but in Spring! Most likely I will be going to berkeley. =] I KEEP THINKIN I PUT SOMETHIN WRONG ON MY UC APPLICATION GEEZ. lol. Anyway this was an epic wait of a day. good luck everyone. ",Berkeley,2015

Congrats to everyone who got in! We're all very deserving. I was notified earlier in the day that I wasn't accepted into USC. However, I'm extremely happy.

I'm extremely happy for all those admitted. To those who weren't, you are special and just as extravagant. Admissions to colleges can't and won't ever define us. Furthermore, another college needs you and your talents. =]

[size=+2]Decision: Accepted [/size]College and Program:  College of Letters and Science Stats:  http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/12151479-post100.htmlGeneral Comments/Congratulations/Venting/Commiserations,etc:  This is a bit late; sorry. Anyway, I am absolutely ecstatic to have been admitted to Berkeley. The acceptance does feel less singular because a great many OOS students have been accepted this year, particularly from my school. However, that doesn't detract from the fact that I have been admitted to one of the world's finest institutions of higher learning. I couldn't be happier, and it is most likely where I will be attending. The location is perfect; it is rather isolated, but a short distance from San Fran. Thus it has the advantages of a rural and urban feel. Not to mention the perfect California weather. I just cannot wait for Berkeley! However, I do know that Berkeley lies on the San Andreas fault and that around the world, earthquakes have been occurring. The possibility that a large-scale earthquake could happen there soon frightens me. I am also waiting on a few Ivy Leagues, but even if I am admitted to one of them, I will still most likely be attending Berkeley. I can't handle the winter cold in the East... Anyway, this is more like an essay than a brief comment. I'll stop now. Congrats to everyone who was admitted and to those who were not, remember that the school that you will eventually attend does not define you or your abilities; the college admissions process is a crapshoot. And finally, the most important question of all, were you on the CalNet ID directory before they took the names off (Yes or No):  Yes, I was. Kind of spoiled my eventual acceptance, but it was reassuring at the time.  ",Berkeley,2015

Rank: 1 out of 8 (tiny school)
Other stats: National Merit Semifinalist (did not advance to Finalist due to citizenship status), AP Scholar with Distinction, a ton of other awards related to my ECs (listed below) that I'm too lazy to type out right now

ECs listed on app: Foreign language learning/tutoring/translating/proofreading (9-12), church youth group (9-12), writing and journalism (10-12), piano (9-12), guitar (10-12)
Job/Work Experience: Volunteer job at Christian publishing company as a proofreader.
Essays (subject and responses): They were all recycled from my responses to other schools' apps, but this also includes my Common App essay, which got a Silver Key in the Personal Essay/Memoir category of the Scholastic Writing Awards, so I assume at least that one was decent. 
Teacher Recs: UCs don't require them.
Counselor Rec: See above.
Applied on (EA?): No such thing as EA at UCs. I think I submitted my UC application in early November.

General Comments/Congratulations/Venting/Commiserations, etc:  I got into all 4 UCs I applied to (including UCLA, UCSD, and UC Irvine), as well as University of Toronto in Canada, but was rejected from all the Ivies save for a waitlist at Columbia. I'm currently trying to get off Columbia's waitlist, but I've already enrolled at Berkeley in the event that the waitlist doesn't work out. Nice meeting you all; the UCB class of 2015 definitely looks like an interesting bunch.  And finally, the most important question of all, were you on the CalNet ID directory before they took the names off (Yes or No): It was a bit late when I found out about the leak. I didn't find my name but I think it probably had already been removed by that time. ",Berkeley,2015

Advice?Commiserations? Feel like bragging?:

I seriously can't believe I got into Berkeley... I got rejected from both UCLA and UC Irvine.. I was expecting to see the ""We regret to inform you.."" but it wasn't..!! My stats, obviously are not stellar, and it's been killing me. However, I've had very unique circumstances because I moved very frequently (3 countries and 9 different schools) and I think I showed in my essays how I coped with this to grow instead of whining about it. Those of you who are worrying that you don't have good stats.. have hope! It's the personality that really matters!!woott

I'm honestly floored that I was accepted, especially since Berkeley has been my dream school for the past several years. Since I was rejected from UCLA, I thought my chances of getting into Berkeley were zero to none. My friends and I were already starting to plan a rejection party for when all of our decisions come out, but now I'm no longer invited! I know my scores are pretty low, my GPA is sort of average, and my extracurriculars are kind of weak, so I guess my essays really did it for me. To those that were accepted as well, congratulations!

I am kind of happy that I got in. And to those out there who were not as lucky as me, know that a college decision does not define you, and that many great people, who were later very successful in their careers, were unable to gain admission to top-tier colleges.
To other who got in- congratulation. Right now I'm between UCLA and Cal, and am waiting on privates. ",Berkeley,2014
