Summer Activities: traveled to S. Korea (talked abt in essays!), COSMOS, tech internships/work, visited colleges, hung out with friends 
Essays: Common App 8/10, lots of people overrate theirs but I honestly think mine were pretty good. An essay consultant said of all the clients he's had my essays stood out to him the most and said I was practically a shoo-in. Pushed diversity in my essay theme.
Why Duke 7/10, focused on interdisciplinary nature of Duke, cliche topic but I think I made it work by spending less time on what it was and more on what it meant to me
Diversity 7/10, focused on how I was a twin and segued into how I came from the countryside instead of the bay area. ""quirky asf. love it"" -my friend
Teacher Recommendation: 6/10, ap chem teacher probably a bit above average, really enthusiastic to write my letter but I barely talked in her class lmao
7/10, ap cs teacher had my older brother and me for a looooong time, absolutely loves me, idk how good his writing skills were though
Counselor Rec: 7/10, usual public school overworked counselor, I definitely stood out to him though since I was the only one going for top colleges and had the stats to do so
Additional Rec: 10/10, retired german teacher, she's basically a mom to me. I was the best in her class and she's such a lovely person I have no doubt this was a 10/10
Interview: 4/10, lol the worst part of my app, lasted barely 20 minutes but we had some pleasant conversation I guess?

Strengths: perfect test scores, course rigor, class rank, worse school so I stood out more, really pushed diversity as my ""spike"" (doesn't make sense ik), had a personality?
Weaknesses: asian male stem, no major awards
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: test scores + essays + ED boost carried me no doubt
General Comments:
I've always been mad at the fact I went to an uncompetitive public school compared to schools like Monta Vista or something but it's honestly a blessing in disguise. It's much easier to stand out, especially with the less rigorous classes. The important part: the first part of admissions is region based. Your app first goes to a regional officer and every college wants diversity so they're more inclined to take an insane asian male stem from a region that's uncompetitive than your everyday bay area asian male stem. Otherwise if you're shooting for top colleges, really push the diversity aspect and make sure your personality comes through . For underclassmen I hella recommend doing a summer program (COSMOS UCD represent!) because it definitely made me more extroverted and sure of what I wanted. ",Duke,2024

ACCEPTED!
*Econ Major? Stats?
*Stats: ACT 35, SAT 2 Math 2 800; AP Stats 5, Lang 5, Physics 4
*GPA W 4.3 (not sure unweighted, but using Naviance, his GPA was a little light for past Duke acceptances from his HS which on average they accepted 4.4 GPA).
*9 AP classes (took on-line Alg 2 class after freshman year to jump ahead to pre-calc)
*Public HS, white male, no financial aid requested
*Triple legacy (Dad undergrad and Fuqua, Mom Fuqua, Uncle undergrad.) But we have only made small donations throughout the years, haha.
*Varsity Wrestling Captain (captain of freshman baseball and JV football.
*Tons of long term community service organizations - worked in public library children's dept for 5 summers, President's Volunteer Service Award 2 years, HOBY ambassador, Best Buddies, Appalachia Service Trips
*Spent last 2 summers doing academic programs at Georgetown and Montana Learning Center - Lewis and Clark Expedition Program.
*Funny, yet insightful essay on how wearing a wrestling singlet strips away (did not use THAT word, lol) facades and allows one to expose (did not use that word either) vulnerabilities which allow engaging and honest sideline discussions and friendships with competitors.
* Good alumni interview - but interviewer was stiff, so not sure a great connection was made.
*Strengths: ACT score. EC's - Community Service involvement and leadership through HOBY and team Captainships. Really strong Guidance Recommendation
*Weakness: Grades could have been a little higher. One B Junior year, a few A-. Only submitted 1 subject test (the other tests taken, Physics 740 and Lit 730 were not strong enough to submit.) No summer job on resume.
*Why he got in - triple legacy plus President's Volunteer Service Awards, 2 years. Overall well rounded applicant. ",Duke,2024

Why Duke: 8/10 Was very specific and I contrasted my Chicago atmosphere to Duke’s campus culture and was specific about things like research opportunities and classes I wanted to take.

Essays:
Common App (10/10) - It was probably the best thing I've ever written. It was about caring for my father who has Parkinson's Disease. I worked on it for months, and a bunch of friends and teachers read over it until it was the best it could be.
Why Duke (8-9/10) - I'm also really proud about this essay; it was very heartfelt and honest about why I loved Duke, which clubs I was interested in, and what made me want to apply ED. Such little space though!!
Diversity (X/10) - N/A - The most diversity I have is Judaism, and I already noted my involvement in starting a Jewish Student Union on the common app extra page. It was a tough choice, but I'm happy I didn't waste time filling out this essay.
Teacher Recommendation:
-Computer Science Teacher (?/10) Honestly, I have no idea how good this is. He's from Kenya, but my counselor said that he was a good writer. I had him for three years, and he is one of my closest teachers.
-Math Teacher (7-8/10) I never read it, but I'm sure it was a good letter. He was an amazing teacher and seemed eloquent. I had a good relationship with him but I wouldn't say I was closest to him.
-Junior Year English Teacher (7-9/10) I never read this one either, but this is definitely a good letter. Her class was very writing-intensive, and I think she probably learned a lot about me through my writing. I also had to fill out a detailed application for her to have when writing it, so I'm sure it was very good. She was a wonderful teacher, and she helped me through the process when I was trying to dispute the 6 on the ACT writing. (Another reason I asked her was actually to justify my 6 on the ACT writing.)
Counselor Rec: (8-10/10) - I filled out a 15 page information sheet for her to draw from, and she definitely knew me pretty well separately from that. I'm sure she wrote an amazing letter that filled in any holes that were not in my application.
Additional Rec: (10/10) - She was someone who has seen me grow up, and she is one of the best writers I know. When I said my common app was the best thing I ever wrote, this is even better.
Interview: (X/10) - N/A - I was really worried when I never received any email from Duke until December, but it turned out that not having an interview did not prevent me from getting in.
Other:
State (if domestic applicant): TN
School Type: Private Catholic
Ethnicity: White (But I chose ""prefer not to answer"" on the application)
Gender: Male
Income Bracket: Not sure probably middle?
Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): Not really - I was not a legacy, I was not first generation, I am a white male, I applied for financial aid. The only special ""hook"" was that I checked off that I was dependent on a veteran, but I never really mentioned it throughout the rest of my application, so I don't think it affected me
Reflection: Today was one of the hardest, most stressful days of my life. When I stepped onto the campus, I knew that this was where I wanted to go. Every second all day I was refreshing the page. I am so lucky that I have been accepted into this awesome university.
Strengths: High scores (other than writing), GREAT essays, PHENOMENAL letters, extracurriculars that I participated in consistently, good volunteer service
Weaknesses: White, male, South
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Honestly, I don't know why I was accepted over some applicants who I am sure have better stats than I do. I'd say the most important thing I did on the common app was FILL OUT THE EXTRA PAGE. It is a free 650 words that no one seemed to mention. There were plenty of people I talked to who didn't even know about it. It's a crime that it's not widely discussed. I used it to expand on some of my extra curriculars, and I included a thank you note at the bottom for reading my application. (I'm not advising whether or not to do this to get in; I just think it's important to thank them for their time. I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't even notice it.)
General Comments: THANK G-D!! Congratulations to everyone who got in, and to the people who didn't, I'm so sorry!

Essays:
Common App 9.7/10) - This essay was one of the best essays Ive ever written. I talked about having to move into my aunts house (a person I had never met before) and to a new country as well. Overcoming these two challenges were some of the hardest things i've ever had to do, but overall, made me who I am today.
Why Duke (9.6/10) - I had recently moved from Costa Rica to the United States, so understanding how to integrate into a new community was very challenging, however, Dukes community is very similar to what I used to have so its a perfect fit.
Diversity (10/10) - I had a lot to say for this essay because I had just moved internationally from Costa Rica. Seeing this culture shock in America really brought some perspective into my world and helped me with a struggling sense of community and integration.
**Very important though, I did not write a sob story, your essay should be about how you have faced adversity and overcome it, in whatever aspect of your life that it may be, not asking for pitty**
Teacher Recommendation:
Teacher (7/10) - My English teacher of two years. We had a good relationship and connection, but he did not really know too much about what I was like outside of the classroom, making it kind of difficult to talk about me.
Teacher (8/10) - My US History teacher. I had a very good relationship with her especially because she managed an after school club with me. She knew me outside of the classroom and I generally participated a lot in her class as well. She liked that I was outgoing and an active member.
Counselor Rec: (10/10) - She played such a major role in my acceptance. She was in my corner every step of the way and guided me along the path. She knew EVERYTHING about me and my story. She was very sympathetic and I got to know her very well and personally over the course of 4 years. When it was time to write my letter, she knew me like a family friend basically.
Additional Rec: (9/10) - My soccer coach and sports medicine teacher. He knew me as a leader in an environment that was not academic. I was the captain of the team and thus, he entrusted me with a lot of responsibility. This however, led him to write me a great letter of rec.
Interview: (6.9/10) - Pretty standard interview, nothing crazy or out of ordinary. I did know the answers to all questions he asked, but wasn't ready for a couple of them which was evident.
Other:

Country (if international applicant): USA

Gender: Male
Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): Nope
Reflection: It can be very easy for students like myself to drive themselves nuts about the ""what if's?"" of their situations. Today was one of the most stressful days of my life and in part because I kept asking myself what if this? what if that? Whatever happens, needed to happen and thats ok.
Strengths: Standardized test score, AP Curriculum, Essays
Weaknesses: GPA, Achievements?
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I think my passion for Duke really shined through my essays. I didn't just tell them how great they were but instead, I talked about why I would be great at Duke. I think the admissions counselors really can tell when someone is genuinely in love with the school or just the name. I think there are definitely people with better stats and records than me but I think my story and voice really helped.
General Comments
I am really by NO means trying to brag or anything, I just want to post what would have helped me when I was applying. I hope this helps in some way. I think there is also a certain level of randomness that goes into these decisions. Nonetheless,  GO Blue Devils!!! ",Duke,2024

Common App (8/10) - Wrote about debate but put a unique spin on the topic which I thought was interesting and fresh; talked about how I used debate to break down echo chambers between my friends and the larger contexts to which I applied those skills like politics, etc.
Why Duke (8/10) - Wrote about SOL and Hart Leadership Program. Thought it was good and very specific to the pedagogy that Duke strives for: education through student engagement. Specifically mentioned my plans to partner with certain groups to fight gerrymandering problems in NC
Diversity (9/10) - Felt this essay was the best one. Wrote about being a mixed kid and the hardships of both carrying inauthenticity but also stereotypes of people of color. Thought it was interesting since I used that narrative and tied it to political work I did and explained how I used my identity as a tool to organize support.
Teacher Recommendation:
Teacher 1 (8/10) - This was from my Physics teacher from the last two years. She also sponsored my school Democrats club I led and other political organizations and has similar alignments to myself.
Teacher 2 (9/10) - Felt that this letter was probably good as I had a strong bond with my US History/TOK teacher over the last two years and he already knew what he wanted to write about me before I asked.
Counselor Rec: (7/10) - We got new counselors senior year, however, this was my good friend's mom so maybe she wrote an okay letter.
Additional Rec: (9.5/10) - This was a letter from my debate coach from the past three years. She had a lot to say about the ways in which I engaged the debate community using both my mentoring skills and identity position and I felt that resonated with Duke's overall message.
Interview: (9.5/10) - Interviewed with a corporate lawyer I had already spoken to at a previous Duke info session and we had similar interests in comic books and political affiliations. I would put 10 but the interview was a while back so I may have forgotten about some things.

Reflection:
Strengths: ECs, GPA, LOR, and Supps
Weaknesses: My ACT was a little below average overall and I think I had little national-level awards for my ECs. Also am a debater which my regional officer said was a little generic.
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I think my ECs, major, and essays really aligned with each other to make one cohesive narrative about me as a student with political passion. I also think that the hobbies I listed in the additional info section helped round out my nerdy side and paint another side to me.

ACCEPTED!
*Econ Major? Stats?
*Stats: ACT 35, SAT 2 Math 2 800; AP Stats 5, Lang 5, Physics 4
*GPA W 4.3 (not sure unweighted, but using Naviance, his GPA was a little light for past Duke acceptances from his HS which on average they accepted 4.4 GPA).
*9 AP classes (took on-line Alg 2 class after freshman year to jump ahead to pre-calc)
*Public HS, white male, no financial aid requested, Connecticut.
*Triple legacy (Dad undergrad and Fuqua, Mom Fuqua, Uncle undergrad.) But we have only made small donations throughout the years, haha.
*Varsity Wrestling Captain (captain of freshman baseball and JV football.
*Tons of long term community service organizations - worked in public library children's dept for 5 summers, President's Volunteer Service Award 2 years, HOBY ambassador, Best Buddies, Appalachia Service Trips
*Spent last 2 summers doing academic programs at Georgetown in Economics and Montana Learning Center - Lewis and Clark Expedition Program.
*Funny, yet insightful essay on how wearing a wrestling singlet strips away (did not use THAT word, lol) facades and allows one to expose (did not use that word either) vulnerabilities which allow engaging and honest sideline discussions and friendships with competitors.
*Diversity essay - not diverse. But wrote about Sunday dinners at my Italian grandmother's with family that consists of a Vietnamese uncle who Grandma adopted, and 2 immediate cousins, both adopted - one from Ethiopia and one from Texas who is Native American and the exchange of culturally interesting foods and conversations - 6/10, but it was all I had!
* Why Duke - besides Duke bball being RELIGION in my house, I highlighted 2 Duke programs - Program II and Duke Engage - and how they my interests for career etc.
* Good alumni interview - but interviewer was stiff, so not sure a great connection was made. 8/10
*Strong recommendations from Latin teacher for 3 years and young Physics teacher I connected with 8/10
* Outstanding guidance recommendation - she has known me and my family since I was 5 and been in class and on teams with her son since K. 10/10
*Strengths: ACT score. EC's - Community Service involvement and leadership through HOBY and team Captainships. Really strong Guidance Recommendation
*Weakness: Grades could have been a little higher. One B Junior year, a few A-. Only submitted 1 subject test (the other tests taken, Physics 740 and Lit 730 were not strong enough to submit.) No summer job on resume.
*Why he got in - triple legacy plus President's Volunteer Service Awards, 2 years. Overall well rounded applicant. ",Duke,2024

Essays:
Common App (8/10) - Honestly I thought it was pretty average as far as how well written it was. I just talked about my passion for making fishing lures. I know it sounds weird, but I talked about the creativity involved in making the different lures. They are specifically for fly fishing, and I figured the Duke AOs might fly fish, which might have helped my case. I related it back to engineering, which is why I think it was stronger than I had realized.
Why Duke (9/10) - I think it was pretty creative, I did like a flash back and forward to my time at Duke and how it answered all of the doubts I had about the school at first. I talked about camping out in K-Ville for the Duke-UNC Basketball game. I also talked about some research I wanted to do with a professor there specifically with their aerospace engineering certificate program.
Diversity (8/10) - Im not a very diverse candidate in terms of race and ethnicity, but I think this essay was pretty good. I talked about my southern roots and how my family is rooted in country music and stuff like that. I also did it in the form of a knock knock joke, which I thought was pretty creative.
Teacher Recommendation:
Teacher (10/10) - This was my Geometry/Algebra 2 teacher and my math team advisor, and this was definitely my best letter. She knows me really well and was definitely able to speak to my strengths in mathematics and leadership.
Teacher 2 (8/10) - This was not as good as the first teacher, but she really likes me so I and sure it was pretty good.
Teacher 3 (6/10) - I got my physics teacher just because I needed a STEM teacher from the past 2 years and he let me read it. At first thought it was pretty good, but then he wrote one for my other friend who also applied to Duke (and got in!) and it was literally the exact same letter, so that probably didn't look too good.
Counselor Rec: (7/10) - I know him pretty well but he had to write a lot and he only wrote it in a span of about 30 minutes so I don't think it was too impressive.
Additional Rec: (9/10) - I got my coach to write it and he let me read it and I think it was pretty good.
Interview: (9/10) - It was honestly just a conversation which I thought went really well. She did not drill me with crazy questions it was just a nice conversation and really a way for me to learn more about Duke.

Essays:
Common App (7/10) - Talked about volunteering and how I've grown with the place I volunteer at now.
Why Duke (10/10) - Talked about Duke's opportunities to combine science with social justice, and an anecdote on how the focus is truly on each student at Duke
Diversity (8.5/10) - Basically a repeat of the inner-city math tutoring, but with more details and a strong statement on how it impacted me included
[FERPA waived for all recommendations, this is just my best guess]
Teacher Recommendation:
English Teacher (9/10) - In a class where only 20% of students received As, I received an A due in part to my being one of the hardest workers she had ever seen. Offered to write me a rec letter without prompting (but made me fill out a 10-page brag form)
Math Teacher (7/10) - Had for 10-12 grade math, and was never super close with her, but a good relationship nonetheless
Counselor Rec: (9/10) - Didn't really have much interaction with her until junior year, but I heard that my extracurricular advisors gave her a really good idea of who I am as a person, and she wrote extensively about my growth as a person and leader through high school
Additional Rec: (9/10) - From professor who mentored my research, saying how he almost never invites high school students to work in his lab for multiple years, but offered me the opportunity because my research was going somewhere. It's too bad Duke has almost no research basis in the field that I did research on in his lab. I got a look at a draft of his letter.
Interview: (4/10) - Went pretty terribly, as it was a very recent graduate and it seemed like I was her first interview. We had absolutely nothing in common, and she was very robotic. I tried to have a conversation with her, but after every answer she wouldn't ask any follow-up questions or anything and would move on to a question about something totally unrelated.

For the longest time my top choice was another university, but after I visited Duke I knew it was where I wanted to go. A bunch of people with similar stats as me got rejected or deferred, so I feel very lucky.
Strengths: Lots of demonstrated leadership in extracurriculars; likely excellent rec letter; stats were overall pretty good
Weaknesses: SAT Essay; wrote my Common App Essay in January and never edited it again; Asian male from a region of the country where many people live but nobody seems to care about
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I think all of my letters and my research experience did the trick, as well as my interest in intersecting science and social justice

Essays:

Why Duke (X/10) - 9/10, discussed how I will take advantage of all of the great resources; emphasized collaboration with students and faculty (e.g. FLUNCH); and balanced this with huge supporter of Duke sports/school spirit.
Diversity (X/10) - wrote about my sexuality, how it doesn't define me, and how religion is important aspect of who I am and how I can/want to help others.

Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): None but played up my Jewish identity and attended a special meeting for prospective jewish applicants hosted by Admissions Dean Guttentag. Apparently is looking to increase Jewish student body (above 10%) more in line with the ivies.
Reflection: I was very surprised I wasn't deferred or rejected but I feel my ""well-roundedness"" (being strong in academics, leadership, social action, and athletics) coupled with very strong LORs and personal essays really showed my authenticity. Since Duke was my #1 choice, I poured my heart into the essays. I also hired a private counselor who ""packaged"" tying together all of my activities and ECs as a great foundation for public policy major.
Strengths: grades, ACT scores, multifaceted student, LORs and essays
Weaknesses: no Subject Tests; no state or national awards, no AP Physics, AP Chem, or AP CS, only 3 years foreign language with one of those years online course, not great AP exams scores (5, 5, 4, 4, 3)

Teacher 2 (8.5/10) - My AP Literature teacher wrote my second rec letter, and, even though we only got to know each other over the course of one year, I believe that she really spoke about my love of analytic thinking and how I go beyond what's required in class to challenge myself.
Counselor Rec: (7/10) - My counselor really got to know more about my interests and academic pursits so I hope it was good!

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I believe that my strong academic interest and dual interests in STEM and the humanities truly benefitted me.

Summer Activities:
Essays (rating 1-10, details): Common App (6/10, tough to rank, it’s risky in the sense that it may not show me in the best light. Talks more of a personal struggle than anything academically/ extracurricular related. The writing was okay but not my best work ever.)
Why Duke/ Trinity: (7/10, Pretty conservative, well written, just a thesis on why I like Duke so much.)
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: Math/ AP Research/ Extended Essay teacher, not really sure tbh, no sense in rating.

Summer Activities: See work experience. (In sophomore year summer I took classes there)
Essays: 9/10 I really poured my heart into them.
Common App: I wrote about my difficulties after moving here in 6th grade, and how I began redefining/reshaping myself after this. (my love of language and math, becoming extroverted & warm hearted after encountering with so many friendly people here)
1st Supplemental: I wrote about Duke's academic freedom and some of Duke's programs that I'm interested (Focus, DukeEngage)
2nd Supplemental: I wrote about my work experience (the community college that I worked in was a really diverse community and I've encountered quite a lot of different people). I saw a lot of really parallel experiences with the students and my colleagues there, and I felt ashamed for having prejudices with community colleges earlier in high school. Since then I began valuing my community as an important part of my education.

Ngl my essays were bomb. I think one way I really stood out was my common app essay. I wrote an extended metaphor comparing myself to an egg casserole. My Why Duke essay was also really detailed and gave a really good picture of the specific things I wanted to do there.
Teacher Recommendation:
Hopefully they were good. I wasn’t allowed to read them. One of my recs was an alumni but I don’t think that did anything.
Counselor Rec:
Again, not allowed to read. Don’t know but I’m generally pretty likeable so hopefully it was good.

Weaknesses: My grades for sure. Weighted I had a 4.22 and that’s all my school reports but they can do the math and comparatively my unweighted is pretty low.
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I think I’m very unique. I have a weird combination of skills, hockey, harp, chinese, etc and I have decent enough grades and good test scores so why not I guess. I don’t think I was like a stellar applicant but I do think that I’m an interesting one which could be all you need.
General Comments: Someone I know who’s also EDd got deferred and I think they were a better applicant than me so really it’s a crapshoot.

Reflection- honestly was so incredibly nervous as I watched CCposts and then saw other decision results coming in. He knew he wanted Duke for the last couple of years but almost talked himself out of applying for fear He was just another white kid with decent stats!
Strengths: SAT, GPA
Weaknesses: SAT 2s
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: not sure but I think he probably stood out in the context of his school and his essays were genuine, not over the top as to why He wanted to be a Bluedevil. Luckily he never came onto CC or might have had a more tough go of the waiting game.
General Comments: I know some of you all are incredibly disappointed and I feel for you. Yesterday sucked waiting for the decisions and I wish that was over for everyone. I was elated for many, and heartbroken for too many others. Although decisions aren’t personal, they feel that way. Give yourself 24 hours to be upset/sad/wallow and then go back to believing in yourselves and rock the next round.

Why Duke: mentioned specific professor I wanted to work with and how much Duke offers, not creative, it was a hard one to write (7/10)

Essays:
Common App (9/10) - Very unique and tied into my intended major.
Why Duke (7/10) - Pretty standard; I talked about the flexibility of Duke's curriculum and how it suits my wide variety of academic interests.
Diversity (9/10) - Pretty bold; I am white but spoke about how I hate the lack of diversity within the school system where I live and how the diversity at Duke will allow me to learn from people who are different from me both in and out the classroom.
Teacher Recommendation:
French teacher (7/10) - I had her 9th grade for French II and 11th grade for AP French, so she knew me pretty well. I was able to read it. Her English isn't the best, but I knew she would have good things to say about me.
Chem teacher (9/10) - He taught me Biochem 9th grade and AP Chem 11th grade. I read the letter, and it's one of the most flattering things I've ever read
Counselor Rec: (7/10) - Probably fine but not extraordinary. I go to a pretty small school, so she knows me pretty well. She also gathered information from my parents and teachers to write it.
Additional Rec: (10/10) - I didn't read this one, but I'm pretty sure it's incredible. She is an English teacher, so I know her writing is phenomenal. She has seen me in a multitude of settings, including as my advisor in 10th grade. As the assistant principal of my school, she oversaw my work with Relay for Life and the Discipline Committee. As the yearbook sponsor, she has seen my passion in that field.
Interview: (9/10) - Ended up being with an old friend's mom. It went really well. We caught up about what I have been up to throughout high school and said she would write great things. When she heard about my deferral she said she hoped Duke ""corrects their mistake,"" which was very sweet.

Strengths: ACT, GPA, strong indication of passion, good recs/interview
Weaknesses: Probably course load because my school doesn't offer APs until sophomore year. Additionally, my school and LA in general rarely have much luck with acceptances.
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I really don't know. I'm grateful to have another shot in regular decision, but I know that most likely my ship has sailed. When it comes to admissions, it's truly a numbers game, and it's heartbreaking to know that no matter how qualified you may be, it may not be enough.

personal statement i made mine a knock knock joke - talked about the doors ive knocked on in my life and how its shaped me as a person super creative
why duke- talked about how i wont just be an economics major but also a researcher that can go into the neuroscience behind why we make decisions we do when buying things and other financial literacy topics along those lines
supplemental (family, religion, shaping your persoective) talked ab how growing up the 3rd child i learned a lot from observation of my older siblings and how i consider that a defining trait of mine then how i watched my grandmother live a life jn debt because of her fiscal irresponsibility so i made it my goal to become financially literate and then help those around me by spreading such an important topic.
Teacher Recommendation:
ap lang / research teacher: 8/10 she liked me but towards end of my junior year i never showed up so it probs weakend our relationshio

Summer Activities:

Essays:
My commonapp essay is a super strong thingy about how I've been forced to realize that I am not black or white. I explained how racism against my curly hair and CONSTANT uneven tan made me accept my true racial identity.
I also did the duke essay about being LGBTQIA+ because I am bisexual and experience a lot of backlash for it.
Additionally, I wrote the diversity one about how a trip to California opened my world. I met a boy who looked white, but was actually very native american and very proud of it (like me). I wrote about how his identity and physical appearance made me proud of who I am, and how I could possibly be that person for someone else.
Teacher Recommendation:
One was from my Honors/AP Chem teacher who I have an extreme emotional attachment to. She is SO intelligent and im assuming she wrote good things
My other is from my honors/AP Bio teacher. While I was in her class the first time I received statewide awards.

Summer Activities: Went to Duke Young Writers' camp for 5 years at Duke, went to North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics Summer Ventures, various other camps and volunteer traveling.
Essays: My main Common App essay was about how I grew up gay in the south. Long story short, my school did not allow a gay-straight-alliance club because it's Christian and the parents picketed the school and fired the headmaster for almost allowing it. People called it ""The Homocaust."" When I came out, as someone who was a visible presence, well-known, intelligent, well-liked, over the four year course of high school I made being gay acceptable at my school. Being gay is now safer at our Christian private school than at the local public school. Synthesized into this experience encouraging me and wanting to better the world through environmental science, mentioned growing up in Appalachia in Southern Ohio, losing my dad to the opioid epidemic, and the many environmental crises that affected my home town.
My why Duke was about the academic opportunities it will provide me, the many clubs I want to join and the activities I want to participate in, etc.
Teacher Recommendation: Latin teacher, was very good. We're super close, go out to lunch over the summer, etc., and she helps me lead the NCJCL as state president. Also got a rec from my APUSH/AP World teacher, was also very strong, traveled to China with her, she knew me as a student and a human being.
Counselor Rec: Super close with my college counselor. I've gone to her house, bonded with her, watched her child, so on and so forth. She's extremely intelligent, went to Duke, and made the case that I was perfect for Duke.
Additional Rec: Got a rec from the Reverend at my school whose father was a big contributor to Duke. He knows me very well, also super close with him, and he happens to be my theater director.
Interview: Went well. Had lots in common with the guy, he knew the same people I did. We mostly talked about politics and the future of the nation. Wasn't an interview in the truest sense, more of getting to know one another.

Summer Activities: Internship with NOAA Southeast Fisheries for two consecutive summers which included going on a research cruise and helping conduct research in the Caribbean the second summer. They paid for all of it (including flights and food). Amazing experience I got from just emailing that I wanted to work in their lad. Got some basic training and was good from there. Highly recommend just ASKING for opportunities. Also, they bought me a mac because they couldn't actually pay me.
Essays:
-Common App: 10/10 worked really hard on it and focused on my passion for Marine Bio/Oceanography (pretty niche) while also being a woman of color (black) really tried to show off my personality, passion, and keenness for Duke
-Supplement:
-Why Duke? talked about how their program is the best in the country which is very true, did a little NOAA name dropping too of former Chief Scientist of NOAA who went there
-Being a minority:
Black and in STEM, also how I engage with my community here
Teacher Recommendation #1: 9/10, he wrote for a friend of mine who got in last year but I honestly haven't seen it and can only guess based on what he told me
Teacher Recommendation #2: 8/10 she doesn't know me as well but she knows how much I love the ocean (she's a marine biologist herself)
Counselor Rec: no idea...
Interview: went well, interviewer said he thought I would be a good fit
Other
State (if domestic applicant): from FL but living in New Mexico at boarding school
Intended major(s): Marine Biology/Biology
School Type: small international boarding school in NM, it's got a partnership with a bunch of universities because our biggest donor also helps pay for our college educations if we go to a school in the US that is a ""Davis"" school
Ethnicity: Black
Gender: Female
Income Bracket: just under 100,000 but older parents (60s)
Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): I'm black, a woman, want to go into STEM in an emerging field and have experience in it.
Reflection
Strengths: black woman in STEM with experience
Weaknesses: test score... honestly didn't think I would get in with that, on probation for alcohol use (took 2 shots and got reported RIP, learned my lesson and haven't engaged since, also told the whole truth when questioned by my school which went a long way)
Why you think you were accepted: The money from being a Davis school is a factor. I also feel that I really showed my personality in my common app. despite having low test score (although good SAT II) and being on probation (apparently they don't really care about alcohol I've been told and I was able to write a reflection on it and show how I've grown from the experience. Another point in which I could show off my character), I knew what I wanted and that Duke could actually get me there.
General Comments: Be yourself. I know it's cliche but its all okay in the end. Do your best on the SAT but don't kill yourself over it. That's not the breaking point and you have so much more to offer the school. I worked really hard on my application and I was SUPER focused in it. I know not everyone knows what they want to do but I feel that it truly helped. I was also invited to the BSAI event (couldn't go because of an event on my campus) which apparently is a likely letter so I sort of knew in advance. Anyway, dont stress! Get your things done and you'll be fine even if you're below the 25 percentile for SAT I and are on probation for alcohol. ",Duke,2023

Summer Activities:
-Very, very prestigious summer program
-Study abroad in France
Essays:
-Common App: 9/10. Shows one instance of my political activism and how I fought sexism in my town to become a leader.
-Why Duke?: 7/10. Honestly thought this was not that great BUT I am a fabulous writer and that probably helped. Compared Duke to my summer program.

Strengths: I have extremely strong and unique ECs, as well as an obvious writing talent. I was also a Robertson semifinalist, which I think pushed my decision to an acceptance.
Weaknesses: I submitted my Duke app before I revised my common app acitivities section, so it was kind of a mess.
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Great stats, good awards, leadership roles. I was honestly very shocked. I've been waitlisted at Vanderbilt, Brown, and Penn, American, and Lehigh, and I was SURE I was going to be waitlisted here. The tears flowed when I saw my decision
General Comments:
Focus on your essays and don't worry if you don't have some fancy shmancy college counselor to edit your Common App! Also, if you're not doing well with elite schools, especially Ivies, it doesn't mean that you won't get into Duke. I'll put my results below so you can see what a total crapshoot it is.

Supplemental was how I myself don't really have a culture I represent, but through my experiences, like spending time with the locals in the Dominican Republic, I have developed and interest to explore other cultures (8/10).
Teacher Recommendation: (9/10) APES teacher from sophomore year and English teacher who taught my in sophomore and junior year (AP Lang in junior). Had great relationships with both and both saw me as a hardworking and friendly person.
Counselor Rec: (9/10) Go to a small school with only about 150 in my class so counselor knew me by name. I've also done many school events like info and curriculum night so they've seen my help around.
Additional Rec:
Interview: (10/10) Had a great conversation and I spent about 3/4 the time just asking her questions about Duke and about life after high school. Probably would have talked for another hour if they didn't have to leave.

Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): None really, my dad is the only one to graduate with a Bachelors in our family, but about twenty years after he first attempted.

ReflectionStrengths: Not really sure, my school is ranked the #1 public school in Washington State so maybe that helped. Great recommendations and interview, and possibly good essays. Unique extracurriculars?
Weaknesses: GPA, Lower-end Test Scores
Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: I think I'm fortunate that my high school is one of the best in the country so I have a lot of opportunities and have a rigorous and unique course load throughout all 4 years. Pretty much all the classes offered are either honors or AP. Also possibly because I have some unique extracurriculars like scuba diving and going to the Dominican Republic.

General Comments: I was honestly surprised that I was deferred because I thought for sure I was going to be rejected with my weaker test scores and lower GPA. Glad that they decided to give me a chance and I hope I can get in during the RD process! ",Duke,2022

its somewhat a crapshoot, I know qualified people who did not get it or who were deferred and I know not-so-qualified people who did get in.

Essays:
Common App Essay: This one was kind of a montage style essay where I took a few key defining events in my life and kind of strung them together to demonstrate my core value of studying science not just to learn more, but to share more. I tried to direct the essay and how I was portrayed not by highlighting how good I might be at math/science but by my dedication to helping other people understand math and science.
Duke Specific:
Why Trinity?
This one kind of talked about the interdisciplinary approach Duke education took and kinda spoke to my status as a third culture child. Not anything particularly innovative but not anything mundane or repetitive either.
What Perspective?
This one was all about my music. I figured that since I had spent so much time in my extracurriculars highlighting my passion for science, my LORs would definitely all mention my science I wanted to highlight that I wasn't just a nerd who studied textbooks nonstop. I told the story of how my experience playing music had allowed me to connect with Jazz Musicians completely in an improvised style the one year I was at Berkeley for the Summer.
Sexual Orientation?
Okay this might be controversial, but I actually did NOT talk about my own orientation. Since it asked ""experiences with sexual orientation"" I actually brought up my experiences of when I discriminated/attacked another person for their orientation. I wasn't trying to be particularly edgy or cool or trying to claim a sob story, but I was (and still am) reeling from a really bad break up and felt the need to get it out there: that I had been really mean to someone for being ""asexual"". I don't know if this helped me or harmed me, but I figured I would be really honest and tell them that I had made mistakes in my anger of attacking another person for being different.
Chemistry Teacher: 9/10 I was one of the very few juniors taking AP Chemistry at my school on top of that I always loved learning about chemistry. Even though I didn't end up getting a 5 on the AP exam I still think she was a huge advocate for me and really tried to understand me as a person when writing my letter of recommendation. She asked in particular about things I did outside of academics solely for fun and we started talking about cooking shows (which I hadn't known beforehand she enjoyed watching as well).
English Teacher: 9.5/10 He was one of those teachers that you couldn't always tell what he thought of you but you knew that if he wrote you a LOR and he liked you it would be damn good. I only later found out (since he was fired over a scandal at our school) that he actually observed me in the classroom and spoke to my strengths as a natural leader that I hadn't really discussed with other teachers and only mentioned in my essay. I think this may have been super beneficial as now you had a teacher backing up the claims I made in my personal statement.
Counselor Rec: 6.5/10 He knew me, but I definitely was not the closest to him, he knew I was a very strong science student and that I participated in a lot of community service centered around that science aspect but beyond that I was never the type to visit his office on a daily basis or talk for great lengths of time on subjects not directly pertinent to the college search/application process. Tl;dr he knew me as a student but not a person.
Additional Rec: none
Interview: 5/10 I think the interviewer liked me but it was a very shady interview since it was in his office in the East part of Shanghai and there were a few other applicants there which he initially started us all off with a group interview.
Country (if international applicant): China
Intended major(s): Chemistry/Biology/Environmental Science
School Type: International Private
Ethnicity: Chinese
Gender: Male
Income Bracket: (I'm not sure how to calculate based on US standards)
Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): none
Strengths: Everything I wrote was very honest and down to earth. I didn't try to portray myself as a particularly smart person nor as a particularly kind and passionate person. A lot of people who later on read my essay noted how strong my voice was which I think might have helped me really stand out as an applicant. I mean if we're honest here, how often do people really write about them attacking another person for their sexuality, especially in this PC culture? Idk, I honestly wrote that supplement in a reckless fit of emotion and didn't have anyone else read it but if my voice wasn't showing through in my other essays, that one definitely showed through.
Weaknesses: I did not have the most recognition at our school for achievements. I was one of those people that when people thought of they would go like ""yeah he's great at science"" but when you ask for achievements they would probably falter and hesitate to answer. I didn't have any concrete evidence of my abilities (not many awards) and so I tried to work them into my essays as soft skills rather than brute force an argument that I was good at science.
Why you think you were accepted: Honestly, I would say it was plain honesty and discussion of my skills as soft skills rather than as a hard achievement.
General Comments: I think that while it's very tempting in the college application process to try and hide mistakes you made in the past, or to write yourself as a super kind/smart/caring whatever person, admission officers aren't stupid and probably have enough experience to see through some ""BS"" so I would say the best approach (at least it worked for me) is to be really honest about everything and try to portray yourself as a normal human being with unique characteristics rather than an altruistic hero (particularly if you normally aren't one).

Teacher Recs, Interview, Summer Internship, Leadership involvement in sports
General Comments:
Super stoked! I applied last minute thinking I would be denied but decided to give it a shot anyway, and was super shocked to be accepted. The Engineering program is exactly what I'm looking for. A couple of my underclassmen and internship friends all love Duke, so that was also part of the reason I applied. I also didn't even realize decisions were out until Duke sent me an email of congratulations! My mom & dad are also super happy, as we have family living near Durham so I wouldn't be as homesick if I were to attend. I haven't received my financial aid offer yet to make a decision, but I'm excited to visit Blue Devil Days soon and see the campus for myself  ",Duke,2022

[ b]Extenuating Circumstances:[/b]
There are 5 people in my one bedroom home. All of them are too young, too old, or too unstable to work. I have been the bread maker in my home since freshman year. We officially make 0 dollars according to our taxes. I work 7 days a week doing anything to make money. I get home late in the evening or at night and proceed to clean or cook for the next day's meal. My mother is too sick and too mentally unstable from alcohol and prescription pill abuse. My sister deals with her own issues as well. My niece is too young and my grandma is too old and sick. She recently battled with cancer and when she had the tumor extracted, I was the one to swab and clean the open gash it left in her head as she recovered. I try my best to manage school and work but a lot of times, I am unable to get all my hw done which is why my GPA is so low. My sister and her baby daddy often engage in violent arguments and I'm the one who has to mediate and shield my niece from watching them fight. I have battled with Housing Courts to not be evicted from our home when the money doesn't reach to pay bills and we actually became homeless last year, though I was able to eventually fight us back into our home.

I'm also Head boy at my school and this role is very expansive. I am in charge of all student committees. The representative of the School to the city of London. Various speeches and events in the city. And ""the city"" is different to what most people consider London, the city is the independent organization that was the original London which still has all sorts of weird traditions but must importantly they form a base for liveries who sponsor hospitals and schools to put kids on the street in schools like mine. So I'm also responsible for contributing on behalf of my school to the causes that the city's organizations partake in.

General comments: I don't understand how this process works. Best of luck to all nervous juniors skimming through these threads - you got this! Also, don't take as many APs as possible in high school. I loaded up on APs my junior & senior year, and I thoroughly regret it. Instead, invest your time into a project or an internship. I can't tell you how many times you'll see ""president of club X"" or ""treasurer of club Y"" posted on these threads. Also, stop reading these results threads in general. Don't try to compare yourself to other people!!! ",Duke,2021
104,"
I thought I would start this with less than 2 days left! This thread's purpose is to help future generations of Duke ED applicants see the type of applications that get accepted, rejected, and deferred (but of course there is much more that can affect an admissions decision than what is stated below) . If you get accepted congratulations for your hard work and dedication, if deferred remember you still get another shot, and if rejected please remember that there's always another place waiting for you around the corner. Please provide as much relevant detail as possible! Thanks and good luck for wherever you may go. - PP

Reflection:
Strengths: recommendations, essay, interview, extracurriculars, additional arts supplement just for the heck of it (very detailed essay about process, research, approach and outcome for a play I directed)
Weaknesses: ACT scores
Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected:
tons of research which helped with the interview and when I met the director of admissions. Both kept emphasising I would be perfect for the school but I didn't want to get my hopes up since they weren't aware of my scores. Interview was 2 hours long, deep, personal and just fun meaningful discussion. I was just as me as I could be tbh and it clicked and I guess they saw that
talked a lot about Duke's generous boundaries both metaphorically and physically speaking, vibrant arts scene, Duke Kunshan and wanting to just dive in and see the things I learn have real world impacts, especially in Nigeria. Also about the importance of community, at home and at boarding school since those are huge parts of my life.
General comments:
I'm still in shock but I am so freaking happy! I think being super passionate and dedicated to not just the stuff I'm interested in but the people around me played a big part in everything. Being introspective and having opinions and having visions for the future in the sense that i may not necessarily know exactly what I will do with what I learn at Duke or while I'm there but i have a lot of ideas and I know what they are directed at! Be honest! Clearly it is about hard work but it's not all about scores! I kept saying they wouldn't accept me because my scores were terrible and i haven't done anything spectacular, even though I plan to, but it happened!! ",Duke,2021

Summer Activities: 3 week mission trip to Hawaii as a member of a touring choir; 2 week grant-funded backpacking and research trip to Yosemite; 3 week French immersion program
Essays:
Common App: mine was very risky; I wrote about growing up through the lens of my experience with a bed bug infestation. I tried to keep it as creative and lighthearted as possible and formatted it almost satirically, relating it all to the five stages of grief.
Why Pratt?: I wove my entire essay around the concept of compassion and how its directly integrated into every facet of Duke, including the engineering curriculum.
Diversity: did not complete
Teacher Recommendation: very strong from 3 teachers (one chemistry, two English)
Counselor Rec: very strong; I got to know my counselor well throughout my time in high school

Weaknesses: too many recommendations(?), no interview, no sports, white/asian, 3 on chem exam
Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: honestly, I saw Duke as a match school for me. I had been set on Stanford, but I fell in love with Duke at the Pratt Open House this fall and decided to apply ED. My parents and I were both pretty confident I would get in, so I was attentive to my application and worked to ensure that the final product wasn't too polished and was entirely me. I did not have anyone proofread my app, and submitted the first draft of my CommonApp essay. I really wanted to make sure that I was being the truest version of myself and I think it worked!

Strengths: My essays were pretty unique, website and tennis accomplishments.
Weaknesses: Stats
Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: My stats could not be overlooked. While I did have personal circumstances as to why certain stats were lower than others, numbers do matter to Duke. To those applying in the future, know that while they say they take a holistic look at applications, if your numbers are too low, you don't really have much of a chance.
General Comments: I really loved Duke. I visited twice, went to info sessions, and while my stats were lower, I hoped for at least a deferral. I disclosed a personal circumstance for why some grades and test scores were lower than others. The grades in the areas I excelled in, however, were pretty much perfect. NY was the state Duke accepted the most applications from this year, making it more competitive as NY resident. Further, having the second highest ED pool, along with the first year of Quest Bridge, did not make it any easier. To those accepted, congratulations. Duke is an amazing school and I hope you all take advantage of the incredible resources they provide. Good luck to future applicants. ",Duke,2021

Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: I think I was accepted based on my essay and interview; I think that grades and test scores are more of a check mark and that the essays/interviews separate applicants. There were people much more qualified than me who didn't make it.
General Comments: If you're going to apply to Duke, I think it's a good idea to respond to the interviewer (if you have the opportunity) as soon as possible. The alumnus in my area sounded pleasantly surprised when I returned his call right away. Also, in the essays and interview I was 100% honest. I had never visited the campus thinking that I wasn't going to get in, but I hope this shows to other people that it's worth a shot! ",Duke,2021

Essays:
Common app (9/10): My absolute favorite essay I have ever written. I went extremely personal and really opened myself up to Duke about me, who I am, and my personal life. I made it fun and light hearten just to make them smile a bit. My English teacher absolutely adored it.
Why Duke (10/10): I really went all out and poured my heart out. I talked all about the research opportunities and the expansive area of cardiology in Duke medicine. I felt like it was very well worded and represented my love for the school very well.
Optional Essay (7-8/10): This essay was meh not bad but not excellent. I talked about my love for English and rhetoric and how that has shaped a very different aspect of my intellectual growth and how that different perspective sets me apart from other pre-med applicants.
Teacher Recommendation:
Teacher #1 (10/10): My AP Biology teacher and was stunning. Actually made me tear me up. It was so genuine and kind hearted that it was almost too good to be true. He really captured my eagerness to become a doctor and pursue cardiology.
Teach #2 (9/10): Didn't read it but it was from my AP lang teacher who I loved so much. She was so much fun and really captivated my interest for rhetorical studies and english. By far one of my favorite classes and teachers.
Counselor Rec: (6/10): Didn't read and probably generic. We had a better than most relationship but thats not saying much given that almost no one really clicks with their counselor.
Additional Rec:
#1 (8/10): One of the orthopedic surgeons I shadowed over the summer. Really nice guy, duke undergrad and medical school graduate. Never read it but I am sure it was pretty good.
#2 (10/10): Awesome recommendation from a distinguished Duke Alumni. He has been a close family friend and it was super great recommendation.
Interview: (9/10): It went very well! It was very fluid. I didn't prepare because I wanted to be pretty candid and who I truly am not a polished, pseudo version of myself. He was a recent Duke medical school graduate so the conversation came naturally.

Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: Definitely my essays, recommendations, and general work ethic. My ACT was really my dead weight.
General Comments:
OKAY most important part.
I have been all over college confidential for the past 3 years, reading everyone's comments about competitive schools and every time feeling so horrible about myself. It seriously made me feel like I was working so hard and really showing my passions for no reasons because almost everyone on here seemed to only care about standardized test scores. Well here I am saying TEST SCORES ARE NOT EVERYTHING! SERIOUSLY! I took the ACT 4 TIMES. I was so unhappy because I felt like colleges only see me as a number and nothing more, and college confidential only seemed to confirm that. I am now proof that test scores aren't everything and that your voice and your personality will shine through to the admissions officers if you just be yourself! To all the people just like me who are worrying so much about their 30+ ACT, STOP! BE YOU! In the end, you WILL find your peace and you will be much happier doing the things you love rather than spending everyday studying for one test that you will take one day of your life. All of that being said, just study your butt off and do your personal best on the exam a couple of time but DO NOT OBSESS over it. Your time is better spent finding your voice. Be you because if you're reading this thread, you're probably already so amazing.

Strengths: My biggest strength was my Why Duke essay. Again i talked about the professor i wanted and how i wanted to take advantage of Duke's programs like SOL and Bass and Data plus.
Weaknesses: I dont have any huge obvious weaknesses, but for me it would definitely be extracurriculars. I do not do a lot outside of church, and that probably showed. everything else in my application was just mediocre for Duke: SAT, GPA, recommendations, essays, etc.
Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected:
To be honest, there is nothing exceptional about my app: grades, test score, extracurriculars, etc. Im just a typical korean church boy. I am just average among applicants to Duke. Also thought I came off way too religious, and maybe that why duke did not (at least) defer me.
Good luck to all RD and future applicants! Hope this helps. ",Duke,2021

Essays:
- (Why Duke?) I really emphasized how much I love their Duke Engagae program there, and how no other school has such program that inculcates the importance of charity and service to all of their students. It was well written and I got it read over many times. On the other hand, the word limit felt limiting since I couldn't elaborate on what the program meant to me personally really.
-(Personal Essay/Common App Essay) Honestly, I believe it was perfect. I really do because I have really low standardized testing scores, but still got a second chance. As you read, there are a couple of rejected applicants with way higher test scores. When I wrote my essay, I made sure it sounded like It was spoken and not written- if that makes any sense and really focused n showing Duke the type of person I am that was not included in my application already. There was no referance to my grades, test scores, how my teachers felt about, or anything quantitative or school related really. I just talked about me.
(Optional Essay) I didn't complete it for my application
Teacher Recommendation: I got two of my favorite teachers that knew me very well to write recs. One has known me since I was a freshman and the other has been my teacher for the past 3 years. I technically waived my FERPA(?) right for both, but one of my teachers let me see it because she didn't care really lol.
Counselor Rec: My counselor is new to me, but I made sure to get close to her and I suspect she wrote a pretty decent rec or a generic one even since she is so busy.

It got to the point when I forgot I was getting interviewed because it became a converation about poltics (since it was day after the election), and IB life since he was considering enrolling his daughter in an IB program the next year.

Reflection
Strengths: My personality speaks Duke tbh. I have many goals for myself and I know how I want to achieve them. I am not a robot most importantly and made sure that I seem very well rounded. Duke is really one of the only premier universities that spends the time to do a holistic review of each application and understands that not everyone is a good test taker like me. My mom even said that my essays combined with my interview, and recommendations are probably the only reason Duke is even giving me the benefit of the doubt.
Weaknesses: My test scores. When I read my defferal letter, I was elated of course since they granted me another chance, but all I could think about was that I could have gotten accpeted and be free from the anticipation if I had a 30 on the ACT for example.
Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected:
I fell in love with Duke when I was a sophomore. My love maybe rubbed off on my application, but I won't ever know. All I know is that I am dedicated in everything I do and only know challenge when it comes to school. My very stressful IB diploma program curriculum itself feels impossible and then I added an AP psych course with it. Duke wants the next big thing and students who share similar qualities of present and past students. Although, no matter how high your grades are, Duke and all other universities want to make sure that you are ready to take on the type of high-level work that is expected for all of their students.
General Comments:
First of all, I tip my hat to those that got accepted because I undoubtedly know you all deserve it. I and a lot of others like me who got deferred should be happy as well though because Duke sees something in all of us, but just doesn't have the space for everyone. Just remember that Duke's process is a bit weird and be grateful that you got this far in the process for this top-ranked school that got over 3,500 applications this year ED alone and you were a part of the one third deferred.
My main advice for the next generation is to just be yourself in your application and focus on something that you are really interested in and push your academics especially throughout high school. With my low ACT and SAT scores, my IB curriculum had to be the only quantitative statistic that made Duke want to still look out for me in the spring.
GOOD LUCK to everyone in all of their future endeavors! ",Duke,2021

@Retracellaira I am in the same condition as you are: great ECs, essays, recs but low test scores. I felt a lot more hopeful after going through what you have written up there. Gotta push Duke for an acceptance letter in March. Best of luck to both of us. ",Duke,2021

Major Awards (USAMO, Intel etc.): AP Scholar w/ Distinction, Deca state awards, community service organization of the year awards, nothing major
Extracurriculars (place leadership in parenthesis): these are the only things i put in my CA:
-varsity volleyball (4 years & captain)
-officer of community service organization (2 years)
-club volleyball (5 years)
-work
-DECA
-paid research internship
-working on a manuscript
-NAHS
-freshman welcome mentor
things i left out:
-NHS
-Language club
-art club
-senior class cabinet member
-camp counselor for half a summer
Job/Work Experience: 2 years as a server
Volunteer/Community service: ran the community service organization at my school. we planned and carried out many drives for canned food and clothes for the underprivileged, collected enough food to make over 19,500 meals when i was a part of the organization
Summer Activities: work and a paid research internship at a top research hospital in the area for one summer. during the internship i created my own research project, presented it in a scientific convention, and am also working on a manuscript to be published with my PI and RA
Essays: (my language was not out of this world amazing)
Why Duke: talked about the atmosphere of a basketball game, the connections that can be made there, whether it be with peers or with professors. overall i think it showed that i did my research and genuinely loved everything about the school.
Common App: nothing was explicitly said about my grades or ECs or anything like that. this focused a lot on my personality: my curious nature and yearning for adventure. i literally wrote about food so if that tells you anything..
Teacher Recommendation: honestly thought both of mine were quite generic, but i suppose they weren't actually too bad (my teachers both sent them to me look at after ) But i'm close with with one of the teachers who wrote my rec, she was my coach for 4 years and we've been through a lot.
Counselor Rec: I asked my counselor if she needed my resume to write one and she was convinced she didn't need to write one so honestly don't even know if she wrote me one, but if she did i would assume it was good. she was my teacher before she became a guidance counselor and i think she likes me.
Additional Rec: Got this from the research assistant/ mentor i worked closely with during my internship. she's very sweet and we did a lot of studies and observations together but also talked about things not related to research. i think this rec also ""tightened"" up my common app personality by showing AOs that i am actually a nice, curious, bubbly person i claim to be in my writing for the CA.

Strengths: essays, gpa, ACT scores, and applying ED
Weaknesses: ECs and lack of hard science APs
Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: i really think i was accepted bc i showed my love for the university and my personality through my app and essays. if you talk to Duke students or browse through social media, you can see Duke looks for bright students who also have a personality and like things other than just school, or really truly love to learn. other than that i honestly have no idea. looking through everyone else's reflections and ECs, i feel so lack luster, but that just shows that there's another factor to Duke admissions than just outrageously cool and amazing ECs or grades. i used to look through these feeds or ""chance me feeds"" and get so intimidated by what everyone else was doing, but i learned i just gotta do me and it'll work out.
General Comments:
i am so incredibly excited and happy to be a blue devil! Good luck to those applying RD, and for those who got accepted ED, i cannot wait to meet you all! To those who got rejected, heads up everyone! There's a place waiting for you, after all, college and your education is what you make of it.
Tips to those applying or going to apply:
BE YOURSELF! especially in those essays! move away from elaborating about your summer mission trip or amazing gpa or the night you won an oscar. think about what's important to you and write about how it impacted you. IMPACT. that's the key word. anything and everything can impact you. also, be smart in your app! list the ECs you actually did things in or liked. chose teachers who can describe who you are, NOT what you've done. your CA has all that already. show that you are three dimensional person.
lastly, i hope my post can help you. i've been on CC for a while and many of the posts have helped me. ",Duke,2021

Hi everyone; if you got into Duke ED, did you get a letter in the mail?
What about people who were deferred or rejected?
I applied to Duke ED and received no letters. Obviously I know this isn't a good sign, but I would like to have something in hard copy. I could never find my admission result because they blocked me out of my onelink account. ",Duke,2021

General Comments: College rejections and deferrals have made me doubt my self-worth and made me bitter. The problem with saying that admissions are ""holistic"" convey to deferred applicants like me that they are rejecting me as a person. It sucks because I was so honest and passionate in my essays. I wanted to show them my BEST self, but they rejected it.
I doubt that I will be accepted in April, and I have now moved on. Although I raised my ACT score in D, I don't want to write them an update letter because I don't want to be devastated again. I'm just going to forget that I even applied until I get rejected in April. ",Duke,2021

I'm finding the silver linings in it. Probably wouldn't have gotten much financial aid so now I won't be on the hook for 60k a year. Looks like I'll most likely be headed to UNC next year.

Essays: My common app essay wasn't very good, but I think my optional essay about being gay and dealing with my Scout troop may have made the difference. My ""Why Duke?"" essay was decent, but it probably isn't as important for ED applicants since applying early already indicates your commitment.
Teacher Recommendation: Apparently not bad enough to get me denied haha. I asked my economics teacher for one and asked that he focus more on my experience in Debate. I also got a recommendation from my biology teacher for a better perspective on what I did in class. It might be a good idea to have recommendations from a teacher who can talk about you in the classroom as well as one from a teacher who can speak to your extracurricular involvement.

Essays: I thought they were all good but.... Common app was the failure prompt, discussed the time I had my phone stolen and how my real failure was yielding to my cynicism towards the world; Why Duke? was about how my volunteer work has sparked my interest in developing economies and how i wanted like to use the school's DukeEngage program; Diversity essay was about having divorced parents and a brother with aspergers, and how I tried to never let either define me

I think I was accepted mainly because I feel I am a well rounded student- the type Duke generally looks for. Being a double legacy obviously helped, but having a upward trajectory of grades, coupled with a great ACT score and good extracurriculars seems to fit what Duke's looking for.

Swam- on club all 4 years, 9/10 for competitive national team (12 hrs/week), 11/12 for summer league (6 hrs/week)
Girls State before senior year
Essays: common app was about Girls State and learning what it means to be a leader/ my aunt dying only a week before it (8/10? I wanted to do something swimming but felt that would be cliche), Why Duke? was okay but I felt I didn't have enough space to really go into detail (6/10), wrote the optional essay about being an LGBT Christian in a conservative state and how Duke's accepting campus for both groups would be perfect for me (10/10, very personal)
Teacher Recommendation: my AP Stats teacher wrote me one, she goes to my church so I thought it would be good but it was rather generic. 5/10? It probably didn't hurt my app but it didn't help. My AP Humanities teacher that nominated me for Girls State wrote my other and it was for sure 10/10, she says I'm one of her favorite students ever
Counselor Rec: probably super generic. She has way too many kids to know who I am
Additional Rec: asked my coach for one, she's known me since I was 10. It was really sweet, and she's a nationally recognized coach (although I'm by no means swimming for Duke I felt this would help)

Reflection
Strengths: strong test scores (without multiple attempts) and grades, interest in politics/ leadership in that and in swimming, Girls State
Weaknesses: no really big uncommon awards, no research, at first glance my app doesn't appear like an engineer's, could use some stronger leadership besides captain, not really a ""hook""
Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: honestly I think it was Girls State and my rec from my humanities teacher that pushed me over. That and being very involved in swimming and volunteer work.
General Comments:
Very excited, Duke is definitely my dream school and biomedical engineering is my dream career. I think conveying that is an important part of the process. One thing I think that set me apart is my involvement in government and politics as an engineering major, I think that's atypical and Duke probably appreciated it. Also, I am super dedicated to swimming and have had 2 major EC's, volunteering, and work related to the sport. The fact that I was accepted is something I take as evidence that Duke doesn't really want someone who ""does it all"", but finds a few things to really focus on. I thought the fact that I wasn't focusing on robotics and medical research to prepare me for my major would hold me back but I guess not. ",Duke,2020

Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): Waldorf education.

Reflection
Strengths:ECs were pretty unique prob Duke worthy, lots of leadership positions, SAT scores
Weaknesses: RANK. My rank pretty much killed my application from the start. If you take easy classes at my school your rank could be better than someone who took several APs. My school gives easy grades I guess, you don't hit a 95 until rank 100-150 or so. My junior year course load- I didn't think through my courses and ended up overwhelmed. I also changed my major- I was on a biology track, but then realized I loved government/policy and entrepreneurship so it may have seemed like the major I applied for didn't connect to the courses I took. My grades junior year in Calc and Chemistry were pretty weak. No sports?
Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: All the weaknesses listed above. I undermined the importance of rank- it would have been higher if I took more humanities classes rather than science.
General Comments: Congratulations to everyone who got accepted!!! For those of you who were rejected: keep your head up, you're just getting started:) Good luck to those of you applying/deferred! ",Duke,2020

General Comments: Future applicants! I hope I don't sound too preachy here...this is simply what I've observed after having gone through this college application process TWICE. At schools like Duke, I’d like to think that everything under the “Objective” category in these threads can only label you competitive (among the top 50% applicants), and it is truly the person you are behind the numbers that will ultimately lead to your acceptance or denial. At the end of the day, an admissions counselor will probably choose to define you (in their mind, because to them you’re simply a stack of papers...unless you've gotten the chance to meet them in person, which is a huge plus) by only a few major points that you mentioned in your application, so make sure you always consider the overall message behind what you’re sending and present yourself in a way that NO ONE ELSE but you ever could. As with many things, being different will usually work to your advantage. Lastly, relax if you can, and remember that admissions counselors have to read a lot of boring applications…so have some fun with yours! Be serious when you need to be, but take the time to try to make them laugh here and there! Fellow ED applicants…If you were lucky enough to be accepted, congratulations! I’m really excited to meet all of you next fall. If not, keep your head up and know that life has a weird way of making sure that what’s best for us will almost always happen in the end.

Essays: wrote about not embracing my heritage and quitting Chines school because I felt that this was un-American and how I redefined American by embracing different cultures. Felt that this essay was very strong and definitely made me seem mature. Why Duke was a little quirky, kinda generic but still very eloquent. For the optional essay I wrote about why I wanted to win ANTM and how it would change the way Asian Americans are seen through media. Thought this essay was amazing, though not that well written
Teacher Recommendation: History and Biology teachers. Both know me extremely well and are fantastic women, extremely inspirational. One went to Stanford and UChicago so you know she's the real deal 10/10

Obviously if grades and test scores were weighed heavily, then those obviously hurt me. New York is super competitive for college, so being compared to these kids with 36, 2400, perfect grades, and who have cured cancer (literally) doesn't look too good for me

•Anti-Discrimination Statement- 9/10. Can be difficult for white dudes, however I wrote about growing up in urban America, and how disheartening ""the ghetto"" can be. I felt this was maybe my most flowery essay I have ever written; I cringed once I read it over a few days ago, but I knew that the essay was well written, just kinda seemed too excited I guess?

Essays: My CommonApp essay was about my figure skating experience. I'm really proud of it because it turned out very personal and showed my personality as well as some professional skills. ""Why Duke?"" was about how studying 20 different subjects affected my passion for interdisciplinary learning and how I can benefit from it at Duke. I also did my optional essay on a highly personal topic (girls in Kazakhstan are taught to marry a rich man and that's it, so I told my story of resisting from this stereotype)

Essays: CA personal statement was 9.5/10, about growing up as a multiracial kid in an all white neighborhood and how that affected my worldview. Very heartfelt and zero pandering, which they must have appreciated. Why Duke was quite bizarre, tbh. Probably in the 6-9/10 range. I wrote it the day the app was due, so it wasn't as refined as my personal statement. I briefly reminisced about how I loved the create-a-player option in sports videogames as a kid b/c I could make players 7'0"", the fastest, strongest, etc. all in one player -- which was essentially how I viewed Duke IRL. Then I dovetailed off of that into talking about Program II, their PPE minor, and the interdisciplinary ethos, all of which coalesced with my educational goals. The diversity essay was 8-10/10, essentially my Brown essay but lengthened 100 words or so. It was on my lunch table, and all the different personalities and interests my friends have. It was pretty fun at the beginning but it ultimately advanced the premise that diversity has become a learning tool for me.
Teacher Recommendations: Didn't see, but from my English and Physics teachers. Picked them to show my well-roundedness (Sci + Humanities), determination, and how I helped others who struggled. That said, I never really knew them on a personal basis -- it's just not my style to schmooze w/ teachers. At worst, it was tepid praise. 6-9/10.
Counselor Rec: Didn't see, but he knew me better than my teachers. Probably solid.
Additional Rec: n/a
Interview: I'm a massive sports fan, so we mostly just talked Duke basketball, especially since he was there when they won the title in 2010 with Nolan Smith, Kyle Singer, John Scheyer, etc. We had some fun banter because my dad went to UNC. He seemed very impressed with my resume and said he was surprised someone with a 2400 could be sociable, haha. That said, it was a relatively middle-of-the-road interview for me. 8/10. Probably didn't count for much in the grand scheme of things.

Essays: For my Common App, I wrote about my culturally mixed upbringing. Long story, short: I was born to a Puerto Rican mother and an American father in New Orleans, Louisiana. I moved to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Katrina. I wrote particularly about my troubles adapting to a new culture and finding my own identity. I conclude by assimilating both American and Puerto Rican culture. I'd give this essay a 9/10. I think my story is pretty unique and crafted it like a story. I displayed my creative writing style by using colorful comparisons and flowery language (cause that how I write). I also revised it about 1,000 times, so it was well made. For ""Why Duke"", I kinda just stuck to the script and mentioned programs I was interested in. Nothing special here, 7/10. For the diversity essay, I reemphasized my Latin heritage in a impassioned manner. Well-written, 8/10.
Teacher Recommendations:11th Grade APUSH teacher and 10th Grade English teacher. Did not see either letter (School Policy), but both are excellent writers and know me personally. I'd guess 8/10.
Counselor Rec: Did not see this letter either, but I'd assume it wasn't too great. One counselor for 130 students, so I'm guessing bad results. I didn't suck up to her either, so i'm betting on 6-7/10.
Additional Rec: Lobbyist for Health company (I interned for her). Excellent letter. Well-written and portrays me as multidimensional and hard-working. 9/10.

Essays:
Common App Main: My common app essay is about moving to America
Duke essays: Discussed why I loved Duke's spirit of adventure and how I can add diversity to the campus (being a first-generation immigrant)
Teacher Recommendations: I had one recommendation from my English Lang teacher that I think was pretty good. He writes very formally and I think he is the best writer out of all of my recs. (9/10) I had the other from my chem teacher. I know my chemistry teacher on a personal level so I think her rec will be pretty good too. (8/10)
Counselor Rec: I've had my counselor write me a rec before for another thing and it was good but not anything exceptional. (7/10)
Additional Rec: I also had a rec from the head of the Prevention Council who I know personally. I think her rec was good and gave insight about me outside of the classroom (9/10)
Interview: I absolutely LOVED my interviewer and interview process in general. I had a really laid-back girl who was currently in med school near my town, which I found really interesting to discuss because I want to go on a pre-med track. Conversation seemed very natural and not strained or awkward at all. I couldn't have asked for a better interview tbh!

Strengths: To be honest, I really didn't expect to be this successful in my college app process. Of course I had good stats, but I think the most important thing was my essays? I really can't tell you for a fact what set me apart, but I'm excited nonetheless!
Weaknesses: Definitely my ECs and even some of my stats. I mean they were good but I don't think they were exceptional. I really do think that Duke looks at the bigger picture when it comes to your application!
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I couldn't tell you if I tried. Only the admissions officers know. Sorry, I know that's not very helpful, but hopefully the other information I've provided can help you discern anything else.

General Comments:
Honestly where I was at the beginning of my college application process versus now couldn't have been night and day. I never thought in a MILLION years I would be getting into the places I've gotten into, let alone Duke. I was literally considering not even applying because I never thought I would get in, so if you're someone who doesn't think you're good enough, the advice I would give you is just to try, because you never know what can happen!

To the rejected, like me, I know it sucks. It sucks a lot. But really, when it comes down to it, we're just a bunch of very talented people fighting for very few spots.

I never in a million years thought I would get into Duke but if you can demonstrate your love for a college and your passion for life through your essays, the admissions officers will be sure to feel it.

Essays:
My Common App essay was about my being Korean and being the first in my family to be born in the United States; the topic sounds rather generic, but its being well-written allowed it to overcome the typical essay tropes of being the child of immigrants. When I asked my AP Lit teacher to read over it, she told me that it was ""beautifully written"" with all the ""poetic"" metaphors that I used to address all the struggles my family has faced adjusting to American culture - all she corrected were a few grammatical errors, but she essentially didn't change a thing.
My ""Why Duke?"" essay was pretty generic too in its topic (talked about the academic prowess and close-knit familial nature of the Blue Devil community), but its execution was pretty unique since I compared myself with a typical rom-com protagonist and Duke with ""The One.""
My diversity essay was (again) about how I am Korean, and I talked about how nosy Koreans tend to be - my opening line was ""There's something to be said about Korean mothers in how they know every other Korean mother, their sons, and their sons' girlfriends.""
Teacher Recommendations:
AP Chemistry teacher - I loved his class (though it may have been the absolute hardest one I've ever taken), and I asked him to write a letter for me since I did struggle in his class and he was able to see me overcome all the challenges his class presented to me.
AP Art History teacher - I loved, loved, LOVED her class and I absolutely loved her. I'm very close with my art history teacher, and we talk a lot outside of class and I always try and make a point of saying hello to her when I can. Honestly, if we were the same age, we'd definitely be the best of friends. Not to sound arrogant or anything, but I'm pretty sure I was (and still am) one of her favorite students, not to mention that I absolutely crushed that class.
AP French teacher - I've had my French teacher for honors French II, honors French IV, and now AP, so I've known her for nearly my entire high school career. We're very close too, and she is well aware of my determination and all the things that I'm involved in outside of school.
Counselor Rec:
Counselor - I'm not at all close with my guidance counselor (mostly because he's a series of uncomplimentary words that would get me reported if I wrote them on here), but he knows how driven I am academically and how involved I am in many of the school's clubs.

Strengths: I am very strong academically, but I'm as equally strong in my involvement in extracurricular activities and the community.
Weaknesses: I wish I had done an internship at some point since it probably would have given me more edge, but hey, I guess that doesn't matter now that I'm in.
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I guess I'm well-rounded with how many things I do, and I'm very passionate about my Korean heritage. My SAT scores worried me a little (esp. since I threw up during the one sitting), but I think I covered that with my strength as a writer (I didn't get chosen as editor-in-chief of the school newspaper for nothing).

In the Rugby VIIs county tournament of 2013 we won First place, and thus represented Sussex in future tournaments.
-Our percussion section of the marching band was asked to perform a Splits performance in the Mansion House in 2014, and we have also been asked to perform in various other events (memorials and weddings primarily).
-I was awarded the Sixth Form Philosophy Scholarship in 2013.

Essays: In my Common App, I wrote about my passion for art and how it helped me overcome the limitations of my physical disability.

Why you think you were accepted: I have no idea I am pretty pleasantly surprised I thought Duke was too much of a reach!
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Accepted Pitt (full tuition), Penn State UP (Schreyer and 10.5k a year), Carnegie Mellon, waitlisted UChicago, rejected Johns Hopkins, waiting on 6 moreGeneral Comments: As I said earlier I'm pretty surprised! Currently Duke is at the top but I already feel bad about possibly giving up Schreyer and paying only some 18k where here I'd pay 69k... I signed up for April 7-8 Blue Devil Days (7 hour drive ugh...) and I'm excited to meet people! Will have to see whether the other schools want me to make my final decision but it's all boiling down!

Subjective:
Extracurriculars: GSA (founder/programs coordinator), acapella (student director), NHS (president), ITS (Vice President), internship at a LGBT youth nonprofit, grant to attend a national LGBT advocacy conference, some journalism internships and chorus and theatre-related honors (I've been a lead in 7 of the 10 shows my school has put on since I've been there). I also successfully campaigned for some LGBT-inclusive policy changes at my school, and fundraised to donate LGBT-inclusive literature to the school library.
Job/Work Experience: Tutoring and babysitting
Volunteer/Community service: I was student chair for a youth literacy nonprofit last summer
Summer Activities: What I mentioned above, a Duke TIP Shakespeare camp, and some other minor stuff
Essays (rating 1-10, details): Common App was good. It was about the suicide of a trans student at a local high school and how that shaped me as an activist - maybe an 8? My Why Duke was really good, I think, very well-researched - 9. My supplemental was pretty edgy and I was sure that I would be rejected partially because of that - it was the diversity question, specifically calling out gender identity and sexuality, and I talked about how people try and define me by my perceived sexuality but I have been shaped much more by my involvement in theatre, reading, etc than by what I can check off on a census. I didn't get an interview, so instead they let me submit an additional writing sample. I sent an essay about my school auditorium and my involvement in theatre that I think is a 9.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: AP Lang teacher. Only knew me for a year, but knew me really well for that year. He let me read the rec and it was incredible - lots about my extracurricular involvement and my academics, ""best of my career"" type stuff. A 10.
Teacher Rec #2: APUSH/Psych teacher. Knew me very well, very praiseful, but not very in-depth. 8
Counselor Rec: I'm not sure. I don't know her very personally, but I'm pretty well-known in the school and she's hooked me up with some great opportunities so I'm sure she likes me.

Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): I don't know - maybe the LGBT advocacy would count? And I didn't go into it very much in my app, but my mom has multiple sclerosis and survived a nearly-fatal boating accident when I was a freshman.
Reflection
Strengths: Extracurriculars. I think my app also made it clear that I live in a small town with very few opportunities, so I made them for myself and used them to their fullest potential.
Weaknesses: My numbers (GPA/tests), demonstrated interest (I didn't tour because I'd already seen the campus at a Duke TIP camp/already knew I was in love with the school)
Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: Leadership (especially the LGBT advocacy)

Counselor Rec: 7+, Didn't have that many interactions with my counselor, but all of my interactions were positive and I was really respectful.
Additional Rec: (Club Swim Coach) 7+ Been swimming with my club swim coach throughout high school and we have a very positive relationship. He mentioned that he was a bit crunched for time though (I officially requested 2 weeks prior to the deadline), so I dunno about the quality of the rec.

Job/Work Experience: nothing significant
Volunteer/Community service: mentor for a mentorship program between high school students and disadvantaged elementary school children, volunteer coaching for youth rugby and badminton
Essays: CA personal essay was about my transition from being a follower to being a leader within my school’s Investment Club and the lessons I have learned along the way. Both Duke supplements were short but I believed they strengthened my application (showed strong interest, initiative within my community)
Teacher Recommendations: One was from my current English AP teacher who has taught me for two years and also coached me rugby. Another was from my Economics AP teacher who only taught me this year but knew me since grade 8. I waived my right to read them but my counsellor told me they were both strong.
Counselor Rec: I have quite a good relationship with my university counsellor since he was also my math teacher last year (struggled with the material but worked hard to achieve okay results). He interviewed me and took lots of notes. He told me his reference focused on my suitability for an interdisciplinary education (computer science, want to go into entrepreneurship in technology) as well as my leadership and influence within the school community.
Additional Rec: Reference from the Investment Club teacher sponsor. He has seen me grown within the club over the past five years so I think he was able to confirm many of the things I wrote about in my CA essay.

Reflection
Strengths: Relatively rigorous courses. My counsellor said my blend of academic and extracurricular interests was quite unique: 1st XV rugby player who enjoys taking Latin, equally content whether I’m lifting weights in the gym with my teammates or editing my photojournalism work by myself. Passionate about economics & finance and want to combine this interest with computer science. Demonstrated leadership in various areas and community-driven.
Weaknesses: my GPA is probably the weakest part of my application, it is near the low end of all the competitive US applicants from my high school (91% grade 11, 93% grade 12), no “hook”
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: As cliché as it sounds, I believe my application showed that Duke and I were a good “fit” (interdisciplinary learning, active contribution to my community, spirited personality / extrovert). Admissions officer remembered me from when she visited our school.

General Comments:
Around this time last year, I assumed that one’s grades and standardized testing scores pre-determined which universities he or she is able to get into. While this is true to a certain extent, I have seen my friends with ridiculously high numbers get rejected from what they thought were their “safeties”. Of the 12 people that applied to Duke from my school, I most likely had one of the lower GPAs yet I was one of the two students who were admitted. I guess the best advice I can give is to not worry too much about the hard numbers and instead spend the effort on letting the intangibles shine through in your application and frame (not falsify!) a convincing narrative on why this school would benefit from having you on their campus.
Lets hope Duke wins the championship tonight! Go Duke! ",Duke,2019

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: when i got the likely letter, admittedly, i was not very affected. i had only initially applied to duke because i had heard the name thrown around here and there and the essays really didn't take a lot of time. i unfortunately regret to say that it was never really on my radar and i had my sights set on the other ""top 10s"" (no matter how much i hate saying that) especially the ivies. it is only after all my decisions came out that i started thinking about it. and when i visited campus in the middle of april, i knew this was the one. i have only fallen in love with duke more and more since then. if there's one thing i can say, it's that the colleges really know who's right for their college, and you really know what college is right for you; if they send you a likely letter, well i mean these people are no novices in what they do, and they seriously see you as a good fit and it really just might be destiny. i know i haven't even spent a week at duke as a student yet and i'm saying all these things but i seriously believe it's all true.

started “Humans of” page for our school community (photojournalism project)
Job/Work Experience: nothing significant
Volunteer/Community service: mentor for a mentorship program between high school students and disadvantaged elementary school children, volunteer coaching for youth rugby and badminton
Essays: CA personal essay was about my transition from being a follower to being a leader within my school’s Investment Club and the lessons I have learned along the way. Both Duke supplements were short but I believed they strengthened my application (showed strong interest, initiative within my community)
Teacher Recommendations: One was from my current English AP teacher who has taught me for two years and also coached me rugby. Another was from my Economics AP teacher who only taught me this year but knew me since grade 8. I waived my right to read them but my counsellor told me they were both strong.
Counselor Rec: I have quite a good relationship with my university counsellor since he was also my math teacher last year (struggled with the material but worked hard to achieve okay results). He interviewed me and took lots of notes. He told me his reference focused on my suitability for an interdisciplinary education (computer science, want to go into entrepreneurship in technology) as well as my leadership and influence within the school community.
Additional Rec: Reference from the Investment Club teacher sponsor. He has seen me grown within the club over the past five years so I think he was able to confirm many of the things I wrote about in my CA essay.

Strengths: Relatively rigorous courses. My counsellor said my blend of academic and extracurricular interests was quite unique: 1st XV rugby player who enjoys taking Latin, equally content whether I’m lifting weights in the gym with my teammates or editing my photojournalism work by myself. Passionate about economics & finance and want to combine this interest with computer science. Demonstrated leadership in various areas and community-driven.
Weaknesses: my GPA is probably the weakest part of my application, it is near the low end of all the competitive US applicants from my high school (91% grade 11, 93% grade 12), no “hook”
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: As cliché as it sounds, I believe my application showed that Duke and I were a good “fit” (interdisciplinary learning, active contribution to my community, spirited personality / extrovert). Admissions officer remembered me from when she visited our school.

General Comments:
Around this time last year, I assumed that one’s grades and standardized testing scores pre-determined which universities he or she is able to get into. While this is true to a certain extent, I have seen my friends with ridiculously high numbers get rejected from what they thought were their “safeties”. Of the 12 people that applied to Duke from my school, I most likely had one of the lower GPAs yet I was one of the two students who were admitted. I guess the best advice I can give is to not worry too much about the hard numbers and instead spend the effort on letting the intangibles shine through in your application and frame (not falsify!) a convincing narrative on why this school would benefit from having you on their campus.

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: when i got the likely letter, admittedly, i was not very affected. i had only initially applied to duke because i had heard the name thrown around here and there and the essays really didn't take a lot of time. i unfortunately regret to say that it was never really on my radar and i had my sights set on the other ""top 10s"" (no matter how much i hate saying that) especially the ivies. it is only after all my decisions came out that i started thinking about it. and when i visited campus in the middle of april, i knew this was the one. i have only fallen in love with duke more and more since then. if there's one thing i can say, it's that the colleges really know who's right for their college, and you really know what college is right for you; if they send you a likely letter, well i mean these people are no novices in what they do, and they seriously see you as a good fit and it really just might be destiny. i know i haven't even spent a week at duke as a student yet and i'm saying all these things but i seriously believe it's all true.

President of Investment Club (manages a $50,000 portfolio on the TSX)
Chair of youth business conference (attended by 250 high school and university students)
Editor-in-chief of school’s visual & literary art publication
School 1st XV rugby (2014 provincial champions)
Active in student government as Prefect of the Arts & Culture committee

started “Humans of” page for our school community (photojournalism project)
Job/Work Experience: nothing significant
Volunteer/Community service: mentor for a mentorship program between high school students and disadvantaged elementary school children, volunteer coaching for youth rugby and badminton
Essays: CA personal essay was about my transition from being a follower to being a leader within my school’s Investment Club and the lessons I have learned along the way. Both Duke supplements were short but I believed they strengthened my application (showed strong interest, initiative within my community)
Teacher Recommendations: One was from my current English AP teacher who has taught me for two years and also coached me rugby. Another was from my Economics AP teacher who only taught me this year but knew me since grade 8. I waived my right to read them but my counsellor told me they were both strong.
Counselor Rec: I have quite a good relationship with my university counsellor since he was also my math teacher last year (struggled with the material but worked hard to achieve okay results). He interviewed me and took lots of notes. He told me his reference focused on my suitability for an interdisciplinary education (computer science, want to go into entrepreneurship in technology) as well as my leadership and influence within the school community.
Additional Rec: Reference from the Investment Club teacher sponsor. He has seen me grown within the club over the past five years so I think he was able to confirm many of the things I wrote about in my CA essay.

Reflection
Strengths: Relatively rigorous courses. My counsellor said my blend of academic and extracurricular interests was quite unique: 1st XV rugby player who enjoys taking Latin, equally content whether I’m lifting weights in the gym with my teammates or editing my photojournalism work by myself. Passionate about economics & finance and want to combine this interest with computer science. Demonstrated leadership in various areas and community-driven.
Weaknesses: my GPA is probably the weakest part of my application, it is near the low end of all the competitive US applicants from my high school (91% grade 11, 93% grade 12), no “hook”
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: As cliché as it sounds, I believe my application showed that Duke and I were a good “fit” (interdisciplinary learning, active contribution to my community, spirited personality / extrovert). Admissions officer remembered me from when she visited our school.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Accepted: NYU Stern, CMU Tepper, USC Marshall, Claremont McKenna College, Babson College, Santa Clara University ; Waitlisted: Dartmouth, Pomona, WUSTL, Pitzer ; Rejected: Brown (deferred ED), Cornell
General Comments:
Around this time last year, I assumed that one’s grades and standardized testing scores pre-determined which universities he or she is able to get into. While this is true to a certain extent, I have seen my friends with ridiculously high numbers get rejected from what they thought were their “safeties”. Of the 12 people that applied to Duke from my school, I most likely had one of the lower GPAs yet I was one of the two students who were admitted. I guess the best advice I can give is to not worry too much about the hard numbers and instead spend the effort on letting the intangibles shine through in your application and frame (not falsify!) a convincing narrative on why this school would benefit from having you on their campus.
Lets hope Duke wins the championship tonight! Go Duke! ",Duke,2019

Volunteer/Community service: Building huts in Cambodia, participating in community development projects in Thailand, conducting research for a social development authority, event planning at school, etc.
Essays: I wrote three essay. I really put my heart into the CommonApp essay. I picked the prompt about a background story central to my identity. It was very personal and I think it might have helped tip the scale in my favor, although it was a bit risqué. Why Duke essay: the word limit did not leave much room for me to expand on anything to be honest, but it was very concise. I wrote about a specific program that really attracted me to Duke. I also talked about how Duke could help me in the future, while at the same time discussed what I could bring to the community. Optional essay: I talked about my school community and how it shaped my outlook socially and intellectually. It's a very simple essay but I thought it was more of a fun, cute kind of essay.

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: In my essays, I focused mainly on bringing out the humanistic side of me.

Job/Work Experience: little bit of tutoring and musical teaching
Essays: i found that the two essay prompts (one mandatory, one optional) were very open and fun to answer. the first one was so short (150 words) but i guess somehow managed, and the second one i just copied-and-pasted a different essay (and cut it down a little bit). i didn't consider both of them particularly stellar and the first one in particular did not feel personal - it felt a little like the essays you'd read from any other applicant ""duke's focus program..blah blah blah...excites me...""
Teacher Recommendations: while i wasn't the most ""curious"" and ""outgoing"" student (and my efforts in the classes were never really great), i do believe the teachers liked me as a person, which may have definitely helped.
Counselor Rec: i was really always close with my counselor and she always loved seeing me and hearing of the things i did so i think it was a good recommendation
Interview: my duke interview was by far my most favorite/best interview. my interviewer was so nice and genuinely interested in everything i had to say (not that the others weren't, but i was legitimately sad when my duke interview came to a close. like had we been similar in age, we really would've been best friends lol). it was also my first starbucks interview, but setting doesn't really make a difference. he was impressed, and i was impressed, and it was just such a nice conversation.

Essays (rating 1-10, details): Common App: 8/10. Idk, it was well written, but I wasn't a huge fan of it. It was almost too deep haha. I wrote about my cultural identity, and how I want to build bridges (metaphorically, of course - I ain't no engineer ).
Supplement: 8-9/10 Kinda cute Why Duke essay... mentioned 2-3 specific things that interested me. I used essentially the same essay for Swarthmore and got a likely from them, but maybe it was too quirky for Duke?

Volunteer/Community service: hospital volunteer, library volunteer
Essays:
Common App (9/10) - really liked this one; it was about my growth as a coxswain and how it taught me confidence and leadership abilities
Why Duke (9/10) - really short and concise (but noticed a small typo at the beginning); focused in on Duke's Statistical Science department and why the specific faculty there will help me succeed
Diversity (10/10) - honestly feel like this was the reason I was accepted; wrote about my unique relationship with my sisters
Teacher Recommendations:
AP World teacher (8/10) - loved my teacher and he loved me, but he writes recs for like 30% of my class so I feel like it was probably pretty generic, although I've been told that he still writes fantastic recs so who knows
Latin 4 teacher (7/10) - not entirely sure why I asked her but she's a super nice woman and doesn't have a mean bone in her body so I'm sure it was pretty good, not sure how well she knows me though/often used her class as a study hall
Counselor Rec: (6/10) she thought I was applying to too many reach schools and no safeties so probably not fantastic, she also doesn't know me that well
Additional Rec:
Interview: (10/10) SO WELL! It was with the mother of a kid that I went to middle school who switched to a private school before high school. She had done a presentation about law for my 6th grade class so I got to ask her if she was that person and told her that she inspired my short-lived dream of becoming a lawyer. She was so sweet and such a wonderful interviewer and didn't make it feel like an interview at all; she estimated it would take about 30 minutes and I ended up staying for an hour

Waiting on: Johns Hopkins, PennGeneral Comments: hope this is helpful to future applicants! I'm honestly over the moon right now, sitting on cloud 9, and absolutely refusing to do any homework. After being deferred Penn ED, I realized Duke was actually my top choice and I cannot believe this, especially after getting waitlisted at Northwestern, Vandy, and WashU! Seriously a dream come true. Congrats to all! Can't wait to see you in the fall! Also, props to those waitlisted/rejected students posting on this forum--I couldn't bring myself to do so for any of the schools I haven't gotten into (but I think I may go back and do that now), so again, for future applicants, take these forums with a grain of salt--they're skewed towards people who got the result that they wanted!

Optional essay: Discussed my transition from living in northern Virginia to the Charlotte area and what impact was made on me.
Teacher Recommendations: 10/10. Close relationship with all 3.

Volunteer/Community service: a program at my school where we educate disenfranchised youth about nutrition and physical activity
Essays: Common App about playing basketball and how I fell in love with it even though I wasn't good, 9/10 and probably the right essay to send to Duke LOL. Why I want to go to Duke was about a bunch of programs and classes that appealed to me, pretty cut-and-dry, 5/10. The 'diversity' essay was the best one: it was a comedic story about being a feminist and how I started the Women's Leadership Club. 10/10
Teacher Recommendations: My two faves, I assume they were both great.
Counselor Rec: She likely did a good job.
Additional Rec: Music theory teacher of 15 years; she's like a family member.

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: My application was read on Taco Tuesday right after lunch.

General Comments: When I got deferred, I applied to a bunch of schools I wouldn't have otherwise. I was kind of blindsided when I got my Duke likely, as I had never imagined I'd get in so it was sort of like being accepted to the University of the Moon. Immediately I threw up everything and visited over spring break. Loved the campus, the vibe, everything. I dropped in on my admissions counselor and, to my utter shock, he knew exactly who I was and asked how my band was doing. (I responded awkwardly enough to make me worry they'd rescind my likely letter.) I've come to realize that, just like my LL said, I am ""exceptionally well-matched"" to Duke. Barring an admit to--I don't know, Stanford--there isn't much that could make me change my mind at this point… (Probably) Duke 2019! ",Duke,2019

Volunteer/Community service: Volunteered 150+ hours at a retirement home for the memory impaired, Worked at the Salk Institute this past summer for over 100 hours in a genomic analysis laboratory
Essays: Actually wrote a poem for my why Duke essay, which I think really helped me stand out among the engineering applicants, for the optional essay about background I described how as a young girl I watched my grandfather deteriorate from Parkinson's and tied it in with my volunteer work. Definitely the poem helped me a lot to stand out, as it was quite catchy
Teacher Recommendations: AP Physics B and C teacher who I know very well and absolutely adore, he is a great teacher and I'm sure he wrote a wonderful letter. My other letter was from my APUSH teacher who was also the Cross Country coach, again, I'm sure it was a great letter as I have known him for the entirety of my time at my school, since coming in as a sophomore
Counselor Rec: probably generic, it's a large school but she seems to genuinely like me
Additional Rec: N/A
Interview: I think it went pretty well, he was an engineering student and a double major so we had a lot in common, as far as what I want to do, didn't go for too long, just about 45 min, which honestly scared me a little.

Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Accepted to UCSD, UCSB Waitlisted at UCLA Rejected from Stanford (Early Action- I knew it was a long shot) and UC Berkeley, Still waiting to hear from Johns Hopkins, Columbia and Harvard
General Comments: I am so ecstatic to be accepted into Duke. I actually thought that I was going to be rejected when I was opening up the portal, but when I saw the first line I screamed and threw my phone. As i was at a track meet, I did manage to scare a lot of people before I started to cry from joy (hahaha). This school has been my top school for a while, and I was really mad at myself for not applying ED because I thought I lost my shot. For any future applicants: do whatever you can to set yourself apart from the rest of the applicants, don't worry if the interview doesn't seem to go well (I was very awkward for me interview). Also don't be discouraged if you get rejected from a school. As long as you work hard and keep your head up, you can do anything, and you will do some amazing things!

Duke Sups- 7/10 I liked them enough. The why Duke was tough for me I guess, but I talked about the service opportunities that resonated for me. And the diversity one I talked about being from a family of 6 kids and how they have accepted me with all my quirks.

Teacher Rec #1: AP Human/APUSH teacher, swim coach, rho kappa and EqualizeOurEarth sponsor, Yale alumna- didn’t read, but assume 10/10

Strengths: I think that my EC's were very strong as well as my grades. I've consistently maintained a 4.0 UW GPA throughout high school. As well, I think that my passion (don't use this word in your essays  ) for helping people really shone through in my essays as well as my curiosity for learning! 
Weaknesses: Could it be any more obvious? My SAT score (achem CR cough cough). I'm an INTERNATIONAL ASIAN FEMALE. I repeat, an INTERNATIONAL ASIAN FEMALE (WITH A LOW SAT SCORE). LIKE WHAT IS LIFE. But I think my high score in the Math section of the SAT as well my high scores in my Math II and Bio M SAT II scores really showed off my area of expertise.
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: It just goes to show how extremely random the entire admit process is, though I couldn't be any happier! 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected:

Accepted: Duke, Johns Hopkins University (JHU), UCLA, UCSD, Waitlisted: UChicago, Berkeley, Rejected: Northwestern, Still waiting for them ivies!General Comments: Honestly, I was pretty bummed after being rejected from Northwestern and thought that Duke was pretty much out of the picture since their acceptance rate is lower. But something shone through and spoke to the adcom, I guess! PEOPLE: YOUR SAT SCORES DO NOT DEFINE YOU AND THEY ARE NOT EVERYTHING. I thought my chances of getting in were very very low (intl students uhhh 5% acceptance rate maybe?) since most asians who apply have stellar SAT reasoning scores. I thought my CR score would bring me down but it didn't! I'm still a bit confused as to how I got into both Duke and JHU but waitlisted from Berkeley ... But nevertheless, I'm super happy! All those applying to Duke in the future: Have really strong EC's with leadership positions and maintain a high GPA (you don't have to have a 4.0 GPA but work hard!), make your essays stellar (some people worked on them from like 4 months but I wrote mine in over a span of 2 days and then spent less than a week editing them), and show them that you will not only take something treasurable from being a Blue Devil but will contribute to the Duke community.

Summer Activities: Traveled to China with family, worked as intern at a regional women's organization, volunteered as a TA at a summer camp, attended summer camp for children with muscular dystrophy
Essays: Common app -- I worked very hard on this essay over the summer because I knew it would be important. I wrote about how from grades 2 to 6, I had an aide in the classroom to help me with obstacles posed by my physical disability (a form of muscular dystrophy) and how she inspired me to always work towards my potential. I emphasized the importance of helping others and the concept of paying it forward.
Teacher Recommendation: I had three recs, and had very good relationships with all three teachers; didn't get to read them but they must have been all great :')
Counselor Rec: I'm super close with my guidance counselor, so I know the rec was very personal and well-written.
Additional Rec: Had a recommendation from a camp counselor I had for two years from my summer camp. She wrote about my leadership and how I mentored younger girls with the same disability. The other was from my peer leadership teacher of 2 years, writing about how I was interviewed then selected to be in an exclusive peer leadership class and my work there. (So grateful to the both of them!)
Common App Essay: See above 
Duke Supplement Essays: Well-written. For the Trinity one, I wrote about my interest in economics of education and my desire to work with a certain professor in the FOCUS program.

Weaknesses: No huge national awards or Intel/research-related competitions
Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: I honestly have no clue how such a prestigious college like Duke could accept me. God has really blessed me and I hope I can use this opportunity to leave a positive mark at Duke while it molds me into a better student/person. This sounds so corny, but it still feels like a fairytale two days later.

Subjective:
Extracurriculars:
President of Investment Club (manages a $50,000 portfolio on the TSX)
Chair of youth business conference (attended by 250 high school and university students)
Editor-in-chief of school’s visual & literary art publication
School 1st XV rugby (2014 provincial champions)
Active in student government as Prefect of the Arts & Culture committee
Head of Photography for school yearbook
Varsity badminton (used to on the provincial junior circuit)
started “Humans of” page for our school community (photojournalism project)
Job/Work Experience: nothing significant
Volunteer/Community service: mentor for a mentorship program between high school students and disadvantaged elementary school children, volunteer coaching for youth rugby and badminton
Essays: CA personal essay was about my transition from being a follower to being a leader within my school’s Investment Club and the lessons I have learned along the way. Both Duke supplements were short but I believed they strengthened my application (showed strong interest, initiative within my community)
Teacher Recommendations: One was from my current English AP teacher who has taught me for two years and also coached me rugby. Another was from my Economics AP teacher who only taught me this year but knew me since grade 8. I waived my right to read them but my counsellor told me they were both strong.
Counselor Rec: I have quite a good relationship with my university counsellor since he was also my math teacher last year (struggled with the material but worked hard to achieve okay results). He interviewed me and took lots of notes. He told me his reference focused on my suitability for an interdisciplinary education (computer science, want to go into entrepreneurship in technology) as well as my leadership and influence within the school community.
Additional Rec: Reference from the Investment Club teacher sponsor. He has seen me grown within the club over the past five years so I think he was able to confirm many of the things I wrote about in my CA essay.
Interview: No interview for Duke

Country (if international applicant): Canada!
School Type: Private, highly competitive

Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): haha I wish. International Asian male with college graduate parents is not the best “hook”
Reflection
Strengths: Relatively rigorous courses. My counsellor said my blend of academic and extracurricular interests was quite unique: 1st XV rugby player who enjoys taking Latin, equally content whether I’m lifting weights in the gym with my teammates or editing my photojournalism work by myself. Passionate about economics & finance and want to combine this interest with computer science. Demonstrated leadership in various areas and community-driven.
Weaknesses: my GPA is probably the weakest part of my application, it is near the low end of all the competitive US applicants from my high school (91% grade 11, 93% grade 12), no “hook”
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: As cliché as it sounds, I believe my application showed that Duke and I were a good “fit” (interdisciplinary learning, active contribution to my community, spirited personality / extrovert). Admissions officer remembered me from when she visited our school.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Accepted: NYU Stern, CMU Tepper, USC Marshall, Claremont McKenna College, Babson College, Santa Clara University ; Waitlisted: Dartmouth, Pomona, WUSTL, Pitzer ; Rejected: Brown (deferred ED), Cornell
General Comments:
Around this time last year, I assumed that one’s grades and standardized testing scores pre-determined which universities he or she is able to get into. While this is true to a certain extent, I have seen my friends with ridiculously high numbers get rejected from what they thought were their “safeties”. Of the 12 people that applied to Duke from my school, I most likely had one of the lower GPAs yet I was one of the two students who were admitted. I guess the best advice I can give is to not worry too much about the hard numbers and instead spend the effort on letting the intangibles shine through in your application and frame (not falsify!) a convincing narrative on why this school would benefit from having you on their campus.
Lets hope Duke wins the championship tonight! Go Duke! ",Duke,2019

Job/Work Experience: LOL none
Volunteer/Community service: Building huts in Cambodia, participating in community development projects in Thailand, conducting research for a social development authority, event planning at school, etc.
Essays: I wrote three essay. I really put my heart into the CommonApp essay. I picked the prompt about a background story central to my identity. It was very personal and I think it might have helped tip the scale in my favor, although it was a bit risqué. Why Duke essay: the word limit did not leave much room for me to expand on anything to be honest, but it was very concise. I wrote about a specific program that really attracted me to Duke. I also talked about how Duke could help me in the future, while at the same time discussed what I could bring to the community. Optional essay: I talked about my school community and how it shaped my outlook socially and intellectually. It's a very simple essay but I thought it was more of a fun, cute kind of essay.

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: In my essays, I focused mainly on bringing out the humanistic side of me. I did not gloss over my achievements that much, but placed more emphasis on conveying my personal qualities. Sometimes, those ""intangible"" qualities might be just what you need to separate you from the rest of the crowd.

Subjective:
Extracurriculars: very strong musical (national/state/region orchestras), athletic (state championships), and community service (200+ hours for two years) background. president of two school clubs
Job/Work Experience: little bit of tutoring and musical teaching
Essays: i found that the two essay prompts (one mandatory, one optional) were very open and fun to answer. the first one was so short (150 words) but i guess somehow managed, and the second one i just copied-and-pasted a different essay (and cut it down a little bit). i didn't consider both of them particularly stellar and the first one in particular did not feel personal - it felt a little like the essays you'd read from any other applicant ""duke's focus program..blah blah blah...excites me...""
Teacher Recommendations: while i wasn't the most ""curious"" and ""outgoing"" student (and my efforts in the classes were never really great), i do believe the teachers liked me as a person, which may have definitely helped.
Counselor Rec: i was really always close with my counselor and she always loved seeing me and hearing of the things i did so i think it was a good recommendation
Interview: my duke interview was by far my most favorite/best interview. my interviewer was so nice and genuinely interested in everything i had to say (not that the others weren't, but i was legitimately sad when my duke interview came to a close. like had we been similar in age, we really would've been best friends lol). it was also my first starbucks interview, but setting doesn't really make a difference. he was impressed, and i was impressed, and it was just such a nice conversation.

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: when i got the likely letter, admittedly, i was not very affected. i had only initially applied to duke because i had heard the name thrown around here and there and the essays really didn't take a lot of time. i unfortunately regret to say that it was never really on my radar and i had my sights set on the other ""top 10s"" (no matter how much i hate saying that) especially the ivies. it is only after all my decisions came out that i started thinking about it. and when i visited campus in the middle of april, i knew this was the one. i have only fallen in love with duke more and more since then. if there's one thing i can say, it's that the colleges really know who's right for their college, and you really know what college is right for you; if they send you a likely letter, well i mean these people are no novices in what they do, and they seriously see you as a good fit and it really just might be destiny. i know i haven't even spent a week at duke as a student yet and i'm saying all these things but i seriously believe it's all true.

I think my essays were very strong and my arts supplement was good. They must have really wanted an opera singer!
General Comments: Congratulations to everyone who got in! To all future applicants reading this who, like me, pored over CC and got depressed when they saw all the 4.0s and 2300s getting rejected, don't worry. It's not impossible. I do really well in things I love (music, history, english), and have had low grades in things I don't (math, science). Clearly Duke wanted me for the things I do excel at.

General Comments: I'm pretty disappointed, as Duke is my dream school and I believe it is the perfect fit for me. Evidently, the admissions officers didn't think so. I will be relentless with this application and try to improve my senior grades (they are pretty good, as I'm giving grades a one last go this time around). Duke University, this will not be the last you hear of me!!  I will be waiting on that RD decision, and keep admissions officers updated with my grades. If I don't get into RD, you can count on seeing me come in as a transfer applicant as well! ",Duke,2018

Strengths: I think my music credentials really helped me. I feel like class rank wasn't a huge deal, but I was ranked number 1. I also sent a lot of supplementary material (clarinet recording, research paper, news article, etc.).
Weaknesses: I didn't have the highest SAT scores and I felt a little unsure about one of my essays (why you want to go to Duke). I also just felt like there were thousands of ""me""- Asian girls with science and music background trying to get in to Duke. It's hard to come off as original when you're in that category.
Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: Maybe because of the ""combo""- science internship, heavily involved in music, good grades
General Comments: I thought junior year sucked, but September-October of senior year was pretty terrible. Especially with Naviance, my gosh that was such a hassle to deal with. But it's done! It's pretty surreal. My overall recommendation when applying to the ""top tier"" schools is to emphasize the things you've shown a strong passion for. They'll know you're dedicated, talented, and hard-working. It's a cliche, but SAT scores and GPA are just numbers. If you're considering Duke, chances are you are qualified ""quantitatively"". Prove that you're more than a number. ",Duke,2018

General Comments:
Don't get hung up about test scores. They are important but not the most important aspect of the whole process. You do not need the perfect scores to get into the top schools. You need personality, and that will show in the essays and interview. If you got deferred or rejected, do not worry too much. I know each and every one of us will get into an amazing school. Also, as long as you do not become bitter or regretful that you did not attend your dream school, I guarantee the college you attend will be lots of fun. College is what you make of it. ",Duke,2018

Congrats to everyone that has been accepted!! And for those who are considering applying, don’t be discouraged by all the craziness of CC. I discovered this site after I submitted my application and was so overwhelmed by some of the posts on here that by the time decisions were released I was convinced I wouldn’t be accepted! Even if you don’t have a perfect GPA or a 2400 SAT score, there is still a chance that you will be admitted. I think that my test scores proved that (I’m serious, I scored in the 37th percentile on the essay portion of the ACT. That should give you hope if nothing else!) ",Duke,2018

General Comments/Advice/Hindsight: I thought I was dead because of my 3.69 GPA but its not impossible. I've gotten accepted to a whole bunch of good colleges with it (granted, I am a URM). Still, a low GPA isnt the end of the fight if you have everything else going for you. I don't think I'm gonna take a spot on the Waitlist. Duke is a great school. Congrats to all that were accepted.

My leaving comment to the other high schoolers is ""Follow you dreams, and don't let anybody tell you 'no.' You really do miss 100% of the shots you don't take."" Good luck! ",Duke,2018

Counselor Rec:
I think it was probably good. My counselor knows me pretty well, and he really wanted me to apply/attend Duke, so maybe that subconsciously came through?

Sent one in last minute from the teacher sponsor for Model UN at my school. Everyone that he's written for has gotten in to their top choice, so he must be doing something right!

General Comments: College admissions does NOT favor the late-bloomers. (I might write up a thread about this.) I was a freakin' introvert freshman and sophomore years and neglected to try new things. The result? The best I could be was a boring applicant with great test scores. I wish I could travel back in time and tell myself to snap out of my introverted shell and do stuff like get elected to the student council or join speech and debate, but now I only have the future to look forward to.

Why you think you were accepted/wait listed/denied: Just ain't good enough I guess
Other Factors:General Comments I guess I shouldn't surprised since it's Duke. Nevertheless when you get 6 waitlists/rejects in one day when you expected at least 1-2 to go well after spending forever on essays and coherent ECs, it's really hard. I'm still recovering since I really was aiming for an east coast top tier school, but I guess I'll recover, hope for G'Town, and if not kill it at UCLA! To future applicants, focus as MUCH as possible on your objective stats because nothing makes or breaks your odds faster. I didn't do as well on my SAT and Subject Tests and that's probably why I was an auto reject. Just to see how arbitrary the admission process is, here are my results (note WUSTL admit, NYU waitlist, Berkeley reject):
Accepted – University of Minnesota, University of Washington, WUSTL, UCLA
Waitlisted – UChicago, NYU, Dartmouth
Rejected – Harvard, Columbia, Duke, Berkeley
Waiting on – Georgetown (probably another waitlist/rejection since I applied MSB) ",Duke,2018

General Comments: Although I got the BSAI letter, it's so much better getting the official admission letter. And the financial aid offer is hot!! My advice to those who want it: be yourself. Be yourself be yourself be yourself. I can't say it enough. I had to learn that colleges want you, not your scores or achievements. Remember that those numbers are only representative of what YOU can do, so if there is any other way for you to showcase your abilities, DO IT! Participate in activities that you are passionate about and activities that will allow you to learn, grow, and develop. Write your essays passionately. Allow someone who doesn't know you well to read it. If it doesn't evoke any type of emotion, then rewrite it. Lastly, apply even if you don't think you'll get in. I didn't think I'd get into Duke or get any of the scholarship offers and acceptances that I got because I doubted myself. This process allows you to grow and you learn a lot about yourself. You just may be surprised! That's about it... Good luck!

Reflection
•Strengths: His ""story""; IB diploma
•Weaknesses: ACT score
•Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: His ACT score was his weakest part; I realize that I am biased, but my son impresses nearly everyone with his poise and composure despite his health issues, which nearly killed him twice. He is able to portray how he has overcome adversity and how he will continue patient care advocacy in the future. I really believe that this was the distinguishing factor. His ACT score certainly did not separate him from the crowd. He really thought that the ADCOM would look at his overall candidacy, but he is not bitter.
•Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: accepted to University of Michigan, Boston College, UNC Chapel Hill, University of Florida, WUSTL, Emory. Wait listed at UVA. Rejected at northwestern and Rice. Awaiting decisions from Vanderbilt, Johns Hopkins, Brown, Penn, Yale, and Harvard
General Comments: If test scores aren't everything, then his strength of character would have been enough to get him in. Oh well, as many of know, it's a random process. I just wonder if with Duke's new policy of reading applications (the first reviewer can make the final decision without a second set of eyes ever seeing the application) had anything to do. Good luck to all of you. My son is OK and knows that Duke's loss will be some other school's big gain. ",Duke,2017

Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected:--- Accepted- SUNY Stonybrook, Macaulay Honors(CUNY City College), CUNY Hunter, BostonU, Johns Hopkins, University of Pennsylvania, & Duke. --- Rejected by Columbia & MIT --- still waiting on NYU (likely acceptance)
General Comments: Interviews are super important! I did interviews for JHU,Upenn, & Duke and I got into all of them even with my terrible resume. Columbia was my first choice and i was rejected without the interview (applied too late to get one). I definitely don't deserve to go to any of these top schools at all. Someone up there must be looking out for me. ",Duke,2017

General Comments:
If my life was a movie, then HYB and MIT would be the crush who's really sadistic and mean and Duke would be the kind of nerdy ""friend-that's-a-boy"" who I never really noticed until he was the only one there for me. I kind of just tacked it on at the end of my applying for colleges because I decided that I should have some more safeties, but as I was writing my essay for it and doing research on the school, I realized that it had what I was looking for even more than the ones I was chasing after because of their prestige.
Only problem now is financial aid...  I hope it works out...
My advice to underclassmen reading these posts is EDUCATE YOURSELVES. I made the mistake of not thinking about college until the summer of my junior year and believing my parents (who are immigrants and know nothing about American colleges now that I think about it) when they said my grades could get me into college, no problem. Learn how to write an essay. Practice interviews... Don't blow off PSATs or SATs. Start thinking about what you want to do for a career and make an effort to try those fields out in high school (Take language courses if you're interested in language, intern at a hospital if you want to pursue medicine).
Congrats to everyone who got in! Hopefully, I'll see you in September! ",Duke,2017

Objective:
•	SAT I (breakdown): Superscore of 2370 (Math 790, CR 800, Writing 780)
•	ACT: Nope
•	SAT II: US History 750 / German 760 / Literature 790
•	Unweighted GPA (out of 4.0): 3.97—B in Physics killed the four-point-oh
•	Rank (percentile if rank is unavailable): 1/1 (homeschooled kid here)
•	AP (place score in parenthesis): English Lang. and Comp. (5) / German Lang. (5) US Gov't and Politics (5)
•	IB (place score in parenthesis): N/A
•	Senior Year Course Load: applied after graduation during gap year; N/A
•	Major Awards (USAMO, Intel etc.): AP Scholar
Subjective:
•	Extracurriculars (place leadership in parenthesis): I emphasized my international travel and volunteer work, and while I didn't hold a leadership position in the traditional sense during those events, I was able to demonstrate their collective effect on my leadership abilities. Other ECs: musician and producer, intramural sports at local grad. school, homeschool honor society (hehe. we have those too. weird.)
•	Job/Work Experience: ran guitar studio with double-digit student count, camp counselor at Handi*Camp (focused on serving disabled teens and adults), babysitting (very common teenage experience), director's assistant for local youth choir
•	Volunteer/Community service: Volunteer worker in Germany from August 2012-2013 (ongoing during time of application—applied from Germany), various and sundry local volunteer positions, church musician and youth leader
•	Summer Activities: lots of travel in Europe, Handi*Camp job, concentrated music production and collaboration efforts, Ancient Greek summer course, fundraising for gap year (after senior year of HS)
•	Essays: strong and eager writer; good hooks and reflections (ie great content) multiple edits to shore up solid drafts. I was also honest about my documented love for UNC Basketball.
•	Teacher Recommendation: never saw them, but I had great relationships with the teachers in question—one was a Princeton prof. with whom I studied.
•	Counselor Rec: as a homeschooler, my father was my counselor, so I'm sure Duke took that bias into consideration. On the other hand, he got his Ph.D from Duke, so maybe that's an equalizer.
•	Additional Rec: A prof. from the German department put in a word.
•	Interview: very nice hour-long talk with a Duke grad at Panera. It was more of a conversation than an interview, but a conversation in which I gave a very good picture of my academic interests and indie kid musical achievements (I knew his daughter thru shows with some other local bands; that was cool and unexpected). We totally hit it off.
Other

•	Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): legacy. and maybe being homeschooled...?
Reflection
•	Strengths: grades, test scores, essays, recs—all in all, I was able to provide a great picture of me, both as a student and as a teenager in love with life.
•	Weaknesses: ECs—non-traditional schooling meant I had to be quite resourceful, and by showing that, I think I kept my ECs from being much of a weakness.
•	Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: solid application bolstered by the fact that I was taking a gap year. I think the concept of taking a year to mature and gain pracitcal experience appeals to a lot of University people.
•	Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Rutgers (New Brunswick), UNC-CH (Robertson Scholarship Finalist), Princeton University (in thru SCEA)—accepted

Essays: I thought they were decent.
Teacher Recommendation: I know that the one from my math teacher had to be great. One of my favorite teachers of all time. I'm starting to doubt the letter from my other teacher. I thought I had a good relationship with her, but I'm starting to doubt it. She didn't seem at all sad when I told her I didn't get in.
Counselor Rec: Didn't read it, but she was very visibly upset when I told her I was rejected. She actually yelled ""NO!"" in the hall way. I feel like it was good though. I go to a small school and I have a good rapport with her.
Additional Rec: N/A
Interview: I thought the interview went well. Ended amicably, I sent a thank you letter, and my interviewer was nice. I messed up on one question (""Why you?""), because it took me a while to think of an answer that didn't sound like I was trying to put others down; that's not who I am. My only complaint was that he wouldn't meet my eyes through the whole interview (which is normally my problem, but I had practiced looking into people's eyes for the whole week just for this).

General Comments:
I'm just really upset. I've dreamed of Duke for most of my life, and I just don't feel like the same person anymore. I feel like I've let down a lot of my teachers and my counselor (telling them when they ask always nets an ""Oh..."" or a ""Really???"" It makes me feel like a total failure.)
I wish that I could get a more definite reason for what was wrong with my application (even though they claim that for the vast majority the answer is ""Nothing"").
I feel a bit purposeless now. It's all I wanted, especially since my other choices have started to seem increasingly unpalatable. If UNC would offer acceptance to Honors Carolina I would accept in a heartbeat, but for now I'm just a bit lost and want to stay inside while refreshing my Duke decision letter and hoping for it to change.

General Comments: it's pretty important to keep your grades up. I think you'd have a better chance getting into schools--for students from competitive demographics, particularly--if you 1) keep your average high and 2) focus on one activity (and by focus, I imply a very high intensity--high ability in specified subject area, significant awards, etc.), which should also be reflected in your recs and school classes. Particularly high level (coveted) students will excel in perhaps two areas, and exceptional students will excel in still more. Again, by excel, I really mean EXCEL. You're selling yourself as a package. Personally, I believe I spread myself out too much to devote as much effort as possible to all my endeavors, but I was interested in a lot of things, and it was my choice to remain involved in all of them rather than condense and create a neat package for admissions officers.

Job/Work Experience:
Service Clerk at Walgreens- 1 year
Volunteer/Community service: Just the Clinic, and other events through NHS
Summer Activities: I went with my school to yellowstone one year, nothing major
Essays: I loved my common app essay, it was about my passion for soccer, and how it has been a constant theme throughout my life (I have an english step dad, lived in Germany etc...) and how I channeled that passion into my community through the clinic I organized. I liked my why Duke at first, but I started with ""work hard, play hard"" which I didn't know was so cliche at the time, and I honestly thought that that might defer me. So happy it didn't
Teacher Recommendation: They were amazing, I got them from 2 teachers I am extremley close with and one was my varsity coach too.

Reflection
Strengths:GPA, Rank, ACT score, Passionate for soccer, Having ""diversity"" by living in an underrepresented region and in another country
Weaknesses: Ethnicity, Why Duke essay, no interview, no recognized leadership positions in Ec's, no national awards
Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: I think I was a competitive applicant who got some luck too
General Comments: I am absoloutley ECSTATIC! Duke is an amazing school, and I can't wait to partake in it's history, and hopefully help make some too.
To other accepted applicants: Congratulations! We did it, the four years of work payed off, I can't wait to meet and become friends with you all!
For those Rejected/Deferred: Don't despair! You are all great applicants, and while I can't imagine how hard it is for you right now, you will get into a great school. If you look back at other applicants who have been rejected and deferred by Duke, they have gotten into great schools such as Princeton, Penn, Berkley and Stanford regular descion. Just because you aren't quite what Duke's looking for doesn't mean you aren't what another school is looking for cause you are a great applicant! Good luck!
For future applicants: First off, this page will be a great resource for you! You can see what general thing you need to meet Duke's lofty standards. You are, however, a unique person and just because one applicant is accepted or rejected does not mean you will accepted or rejected. Just pour your heart into your passion and really show you have a passion for Duke.
Secondly, I would say really try to limit your time on CC. There are some really great people on here, but some of these applicants are the cream of the crop, and have stellar credentials. There is nothing saying that they are telling the truth either, so you can't gleam too much from what people say.
Thirdly, ""Chances"" do not matter. Most people say the same thing "" It's a reach but you have a chance. Just make sure your Ec's are stellar and write a great essay"" As you can see, my Ecs are far from stellar, but I was still accepted. What I did is really explore my passion of soccer, and did something out of the ordinary. The important thing is, I didn't do it for Duke or any other college, I did it because it was something I was truly passionate about. You are unique, so find what's unique about you, and really convince Duke that they need your uniqueness. The rest is down to the randomness of the admissions process. It is so stressful, so just try to not think about. Once your application is in, it's in, there's nothing you can do. Good luck to all future applicants, and I can't wait to be a Blue Devil!!!

Reflection
Strengths: Enough credits to graduate twice from high school; lots of my APs were taken online because they were not offered at my high school; volunteering; Why Duke essay; very rural and uncompetitive school and was able to do pretty well nationally
Weaknesses: Testing scores could definitely have been higher; no hooks; not as many extracurriculars, esp sports; no paid job;
Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: For the strengths listed above - but I really think they look at everyone individually. I think that they see that despite the fact that my testing scores aren't amazing, they can see that I'm really dedicated and that I work my tail off to get my grades - especially my AP!
General Comments:
Wow, so. I got in. I got in. It's been almost five hours and it still hasn't quite hit me. I'm kind of ridiculously giddy and congrats to all of my fellow acceptees! For everyone who was deferred, I hope to see you among us come April. As for the unfortunately rejected - I'm so sorry that you didn't get in. To be honest, I really thought that I would be among your number. Keep your chin up - a rejection doesn't mean that you're not good enough, and it certainly doesn't mean that you can't go to another amazing school. Good luck, and best wishes to all! ",Duke,2017

I really need to be close by to my family and my mom is already living in North Carolina, I don't know how I'll function without being near them. She has health problems and I'm worried about not seeing her enough. I've been having anxiety issues this year and now I have to go another few months without knowing where I'm going to college.

Hopefully going ED helped to express this strong desire. The great test scores in the technical subjects probably also helped.
General Comments:
Wondered if we should go ED because of financial reasons, and thought he still had a good chance RD, but Duke was by far and away his number one choice, and that's what ED is for, right?

Got the decision, and put on a good face, all all that, thought i was at peace with the decision. Went to school, to spanish, where the teacher was poking fun at me for not doing my homework properly(obviously I was not thinking properly) and staring off into space during class... then i went up to her after class to apologize for not being completely focused, then started choking on my words a bit.... then ran into one of my rec. teachers(who went to Duke) and talked to him a little bit.... ended up going to the bathroom afterwords and crying for fifteen minutes..... guess all that suppressed sorrow had to come out eventually!

Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: I really come alive in essays, so that might be it.

I stayed in a dorm with two of their freshmen for 3 days. They must've liked me  And the fact that the Dean of Undergraduate Admissions basically convinced me to change my early app from Stanford to Duke.
They must pride themselves on stealing students from Stanford

Essays: Why Duke was excellent, precise, and well-written. Common App could have been a hit or miss since I took an incredibly creative route. If it was a hit, then I'm sure it was one of the best essays the adcom has ever read. If it was a miss, I guess the rest of my application made up for it.
Teacher Recommendation: Although I never read them, my thoughts are: APUSH - strong, Spanish - generic

I hope to maybe see some of you at grad school at Duke because this rejection isn't going to stop me from reaching my goal of being a Duke Alumni! ",Duke,2017

Well, I guess I'll post some stats for those who are reading this in the future. I feel so terrible right now, my legacy classmate got rejected so at least I shouldn't feel as inferior right now as I do but man.
Asian Male from WA
one of the top HS'es in WA, top-50 ranked. 17% in my class...
SAT Breakdown: 2260 (720M, 740 CR, 800W) but after december SAT, will be superscored: >2340(800M,>740 CR, 800W).
GPA: 3.86, 4.33 weighted
most rigorous schedule, and taking 6 AP's senior year (equiv. 8 tests)
solid recs, essays, sent in everything I could've.
IMO unique EC's that should only improve, as my partner and I are set to dominate at DECA this year (I got the highest score in 4 years at our school on this year's test)

I'm really sorry I'm not in the mood to type out all my stats right now, but here are the standardized test scores and stuff.
This post isn't really...coherent? This is not really my typical writing style. Can't really think straight right now, but I hope this helps.
If ANYONE has any advice for me, I'd love to hear it. Thank you.Objective:
SAT I (breakdown): ~1900? I don't remember and I'm not going to check.
Yes, this is a horrendous score, but I'm not that good a test taker tbh, and yes, I've taken it twice. Guess some things are just not meant to be - my grades reflect my ability better.
ACT: /
SAT II: French 760 Chinese 770 Lit 670
Unweighted GPA (out of 4.0): (international applicant - no GPA system, but if you calculate it then I guess around 3.8? Not sure.)
Rank (percentile if rank is unavailable): Top 5%
IGCSEs -Took a couple as a supplement to my school curriculum.
Strengths: Essays, great recs (an awesome personal rec from my best friend), interview went pretty well.
ECs were cohesive - displayed my passion really well, my essays + interview all reflected this.
My grades are pretty good as well, I would be a better applicant if my SAT scores were much higher.
All I can is that my application was cohesive. Yep.
Weaknesses: SAT scores. Yeah.
GENERAL COMMENTS:
I've applied to a few other universities so I'm not too sad, but I'm surely going to do my best to get off the waiting list. Duke is  and I would do anything to get in.
TO ALL THOSE WHO ARE LURKING ON CC: Just apply and try your best. I'm living proof that Duke will read your applications, after all, they looked past my SAT score and didn't reject me instantly.
Aim high. At least you won't have any regrets - by aiming for Duke, I set the bar for myself REALLY HIGH. Pushed myself to the limit - or else I would have gotten the two scholarships (I was a HORRIBLE student in Freshman year. Not kidding. 3Ds, 4As and a couple of Bs). Got to get out of my comfort zone.
Essays can really make or break your application, don't think I would have gotten so far without them. All I did was write 'em, ask my English teacher to proofread and ask my friends to read 'em to see if they sound ""like me"", i.e. my own voice.
If ANYONE has any advice for me, please, please tell me.
---
CONGRATULATIONS TO ALL THOSE WHO WERE ACCEPTED. 
And to those rejected, don't lose heart - other universities will be really lucky to have you. Duke is not the only place where you can get a great education and be happy.

General Comments:
My daughter has not been dreaming of Duke since 9th grade. Pratt came onto her radar while researching BME schools and she went for a visit last summer. Once her college rankings were complete, Duke was on top and I encouraged her to apply ED so she could possibly get an acceptance before Christmas. We knew it was a reach based on her SAT I scores but felt it was worth the application effort based on the balance of her academic profile.
The deferral tells me that Duke does consider the entire academic profile. If 2000 - 2100 was a cut-off level for SAT I scores, she would have been rejected outright. We reviewed a plan last night to improve the SAT I scores and reaffirm her interest in Duke before the RD date. ",Duke,2016

Based on the stats results posted here so far, i would have to say the the quality of the acceptances to Duke ED is pretty spotty. Basically, this is below Ivy standard, disappointing and Duke admissions ought to be ashamed. For their sake, i hope they get their act together by the RD round. Some of these admissions have been atrocioius! ",Duke,2016
