Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: Physics teacher: 10/10. Have had him 2 years, am able to talk to him about basically anything.
Teacher Rec #2: Orchestra director: 10/10. Probably talked about how she moved schools the year I became president so I had to take over parts of her job.
Counselor Rec: 7/10. I go to a big public school so counselors do not know people well so I asked my principal to write mine and although he doesn’t know me that well, I think it carries weight that my principal wrote it instead of counselors (?)
Additional Rec: French teacher: 7/10. Have had her 2 years, knows me relatively well because I’m co-pres of FNHS.
Interview: 10/10. Went extremely, overwhelmingly well. Interviewer said I was one of the best candidates he has ever interviewed. Had a genuine conversation and by the end we were making jokes and he was roasting me in a family-like way (lol). Said I make him excited for the future of Stanford and the world.

Essays (rating 1-10, details):
Common App: 8/10. Pretty proud of this one. Depicted my experience at the Earth Science Olympiad, my growth as a person there - in terms of teamwork and my newfound desire to be a Climate activist and do research to help mitigate climate change.
Activity essay: 5/10. Talked about Science Infinity (nonprofit, see ecs) and my passion for teaching/helping others and its accomplishments. Not super proud of the way it was written, don't feel I expressed my passion fully.
Most Significant Challenge: 7.5/10. Feel like I used the 50 words in the fullest to express my concern for the changing climate.
Last 2 Summers: 7/10. I liked this, I covered the academic side of my summers by mentioning my summer camps, but focused on my favorite non-academic memory from each camp.
Historical Moment or event: 6/10. Talked about being a part of the control room of the Apollo 11 mission.
What 5 words best describe you. Took a risk here, not sure if they would've received it positively or not:
engagEd
compAssionate
eneRgetic
sponTaneous
insigHtful
Read, Listen, Watch: 5/10. Nothing special, talked about my interests like frisbee, a capella mashups, favorite shows, Earth Science and bollywood movies.
Looking forward to: 6/10. Talked about my hobby for Ultimate frisbee and interest in pursuing it.

Excited about learning: 8/10. Talked about the curiosity I feel when I learn something completely novel, used a specific example of a problem at Stanford Math Camp
Future Roommate: 7/10. Kinda stylistically different from my other essays, described my interests and how I imagined our time together would go.
Meaningful: 6/10. Why the Earth is meaningful to me. Not sure I expressed my passion as fully as I could've.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: 8-9. English teacher, believe he had a high opinion of me. He wrote a rec for Stanford Math Camp, and he is a very good writer.
Teacher Rec #2: 7-8. Physics teacher. helped him a lot in class, believe he also has a high opinion of me.
Counselor Rec: 5-6. Counselor definitely has a good opinion of me, but haven't spent time with her or connected with her in a way I have with my teachers. That being said, I did provide a lot of personal details with ehr as part of my request for a recommendation.
Additional Rec: 9-10. Leader of United States Earth Science Olympiad. Believe he had a high opinion of me, and greatly appreciated me and my help at the camp. Would have definitely written a strong recommendation, IMO.
Interview: 6-7. Covered a lot about me, but no real conversation. Felt like an actual interview, not a conversation, as I've heard much of the interviews have been like.

Reflection
Strengths: Overall I think I am a well-rounded applicant. Stanford is my dream school and I think that showed. While no real legacy, many past United States Earth Science Olympiad students have gone to Stanford, and Stanford University mathematics Camp may have been looked upon favorably.
Weaknesses: My essays were definitely a weakness. Besides the common app essay, they were likely around average, even if they are good for my writing abilities.
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I think a good portion of my acceptance rested on my achievements and recommendations, and my common app essay. My supplementals had some good ideas in my opinion but the message/writing/passion may not have come across as strongly. ",Stanford,2024

Strengths: Have placed top 10 nationally in a competition. Great SAT Scores. Unique essays overall. Grades probably average for Stanford. Good other extracurriculars.
Weaknesses: My school doesn’t offer a lot of APs so maybe my schedule strength was a weakness even tho I took bc and multi freshman and sophomore year. My top ten nationally wasn’t in academia which would have helped. None of these school rly understands how hard chess is compared to math and science and stuff
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected:
No legacy, didn’t pay my way in, white, male, didn’t have anything to push me over the top.

- Common App: 8/10, went in-depth into how I modeled my mindset through my experiences and activities throughout my high school career. Was a bit broad and possibly wordy.
- Roommate: 9.5/10, gave a list of ""Fun Me Facts"" that gave a really good impression of my personality. Ended a bit abruptly because I couldn't fit everything in the word limit.
- Learning: 9/10, went into my fascination with mathematics and described it as the ""code"" of the universe. Might've been a bit technical, especially when I described the beauty of Fourier Series.
- Meaningful: 9.5/10, used a stuffed dog my parents gave me when I was a year old as a metaphor for change throughout my life. Made some commentary on how the outside world shaped my childhood and led to who I am today, but could have been a bit unorthodox.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): Waived FERPA, don't know specifics
Teacher Rec #1: 10/10, from my calculus (multi and single variable), economics, and stats teacher. He and I would often discuss high-level topics that were beyond the scope of the class in question, and he is without question my favorite teacher. Since I've had him for numerous different classes, he probably went into my academic excellence, ability to learn anything quickly and shift thinking styles, and insatiable curiosity.
Teacher Rec #2: 10/10, from my robotics coach and engineering teacher from sophomore to junior year (was also my SciO coach from freshman to junior year). She and I would often talk about various engineering topics and shared an immense interest in robotics. Probably talked about my passion and talent in engineering with emphasis on my problem-solving and communication skills, as well as my determination and strength as a competitor.
Counselor Rec: 7.5/10, I come from a large public school so she probably didn't go into too much detail. However we talked on at least a few occasions so it probably wasn't overly generic.
Additional Rec: 10/10, from my SciO coach and AP chemistry teacher who's known me since freshman year. She and I often joked around with each other and talked about general life things. Probably went into how I've grown into who I am today, with emphasis on how I interact with teammates and became a leader
Interview: Wasn't offered one, probably due to the fact that I live in a semi-rural area :-(

Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): (not sure if this counts but) mixed culture (dad is a Polish immigrant, mom is a US national)
Reflection
Strengths: Great test scores and transcript, recommendations were likely stellar, showed a massive spike in engineering throughout my application, extracurriculars showed a passion for collaboration and STEM, first in my rather large class
Weaknesses: Generic white male applying from a generic midwest public school, essays could have been better, lack of an interview that would solidify my personality, no prestigious awards
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected:
Probably didn't stand out enough. My essays were average, extracurriculars were what everyone else was doing, and didn't have any prestigious awards to differentiate me from literally every other white person applying from a midwestern public school. However, I'm really not too disappointed. I knew going in that my chances were extraordinarily small, but I figured that trying was better than not knowing at all. Congratulations to everyone that got in, you deserve it! Now I'm going for Princeton, hoping to take what I've learned from Stanford and craft an exquisite application :-$ ",Stanford,2024

Subjective
Extracurriculars (place leadership in parenthesis):
Asian Awareness Society (Secretary 10, President 11-12)- originally a Kpop club run by mostly non-Asians (was named Asian Appreciation instead of Asian Awareness). I placed this highest on my list because I put in a lot of work with a few of my other Asian classmates to collaborate with the Black Awareness sponsor of our school and reform the club to incorporate some pop culture with relevant presentations.
Game Development (9-12)- huge part of my magnet program and mentioned that my games have won awards
Varsity Badminton (10-12)
Japanese Self-Study (9-12)- used this to mention Japanese awards I received prior to HS
Class Treasurer (10-11)
NEHS VP (12)
Job/Work Experience:
Barista at Kung Fu Tea (11-12)
Volunteer/Community service:
Summer Infection Control Volunteer at local hospital (10)

Additional Info: Mentioned my certification in photoshop and proficiency in Adobe Apps + programming languages due to my magnet in school (C#, Java, C++, plus HTML) along with my acceleration from French 2 to French 4 in sophomore year at the recommendation of my previous teacher
Essays (rating 1-10, details):
Common App: 9/10- Wrote about my name and how it has affected my life and forced me to speak up (I have two first names but I go by the second one). Pretty simple topic, but it’s something that only I could have written. Even connected it to my intended field of study (linguistics). My writing isn’t particularly world-class but I think my growth really shone through.
Activity: 6/10- Was very straightforward in this one- honestly didn’t think of it as an essay. Gave a breakdown of my work with Asian Awareness since I couldn’t expand too much in 150 words
Short Answers (9.5/10 overall)- I strongly believe that these and the 3 essays below are the reason I was accepted. I let loose and most of the people who read my application laughed pretty hard at what I wrote. I think whoever accepted me did the same.
Intellectual Vitality (8/10)- Wrote about my passion towards language
Roommate letter (9.5/10)- I used a really weird format that was a big risk for me. I think the unconventional setup in conjunction with being completely myself helped a looooot.
Meaningful (8.5/10)- I wrote about chicken tenders:)
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): Waived FERPA, but I’m assuming
Teacher Rec #1: French teacher (9/10)- Not particularly close with her, but we have a great relationship within school. I think she understood my passion for language better than anyone else and my former French teacher talked about me to her quite often. She is also quite a good writer from what I have seen.
Teacher Rec #2: Calc teacher (8/10)- Black Awareness sponsor and was pivotal in our reformation of Asian Awareness. I’m pretty close with her and TA for her now.
*Didn’t find this out until after requesting, but both teachers are known for extremely good rec letters. Funnily enough the one girl from my school who got into Yale last year also got recommendations from both of them and the same counselor.
Counselor Rec: 5/10- content is probably good but she doesn’t know me well. She can’t even pronounce the name I go by and I’m almost certain she wrote my other name in the letter despite what I wrote about in my CA essay.
Additional Rec: N/A
Interview: None- my interviewer never replied to my emails (this worried me a lot since I thought they would think I declined, but admissions understood)

Reflection
Strengths: Very clear about what I want to pursue and used this to tie every part of my application together. I think the fun and non-academic side of my personality was very apparent through my writing. Basically just a good combination of strong academics, passion, and humor. My application read exactly like me (unlike this post hahaha)
Weaknesses: No out-of-this-world accomplishments, kinda thought my ECs were a bit stereotypical (badminton, Asian Awareness), ECs were also basic compared to other applicants, little community service
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Convinced that I made my AO laugh:) I think my personality and outlook made me stand out in the sea of Asian males in CS ",Stanford,2024

Essays (rating 1-10, details):
-Common App (5). It's very me and I like it, however, I don't think AOs will and did, in this case. Talks about too many things.
-Supplement (7). All over the place, as well, but very lighthearted which I thought is what they wanted to see, as well. IV essay did not reveal enough about me, that was my mistake.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: 9/10. Econ teacher & Speech and Debate advisor. Could talk about me academically and extracurricular. Did extremely well in her class. She was confident I'd get in. I asked her to focus on my intellectual vitality.
Teacher Rec #2: 9/10. English teacher. Made the school give me a citizenship award. Pointed out all of the little things I did to me one day and thanked me for it and being in her class. I asked her to focus on my personality.
Counselor Rec: 6/10. I go to a large public school. My counselor, at best, could give a basic rundown and explain me switching schools.
Additional Rec: 9/10. From the chairman of the non-profit I help manage. Talked about the national programs I spearheaded and how I'm good at management.
Interview: 9/10. Talked for 1hr and 30min. Covered everything. My interviewer loved what I was interested in and we had a long conversation about it. Emailed him after the decision and asked if I could do anything differently going ahead and he said no.

Essays (rating 1-10, details):
What makes me love learning -- I wanted to be unique, so I wrote about my love of philosophy (broad), then narrowed it down to how I investigated (and eventually spoke publicly) about Iranian contemporary art as a reflection of political intellectualism (narrow). Very descriptive about what I did, and how much fun I had learning about it. I also detailed that learning about art made me experience a “spiritual transformation”. Quite honest about how I “no longer treat art as a mere subject, a mere entity that must be learned” and now use art “as a means by which I learn everything-- from politics to philosophy and design-- all into one education which I can love indefinitely”.
What is meaningful to you -- I wrote, quite graphically and passionately, about the terrors and cruelty experienced by Middle Easterners in their fight against tyranny and despotism. I wrote that, these people, who “are eternal lovers of wisdom”, “provide my life with meaning”.
Roommate - very silly and fun. I wrote about how I’d share my fruits from the farmers market, my K-beauty skin care products, and how I’d love to go on roadtrips, political lectures, and bodybuilding classes with her.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: 1000. This woman is the light of my life, and I think we love each other. I’ve planted gardens with her, spoken publicly in front of hundreds about how amazing she is, how she’s changed my life. It’s blatant that we love each other. She’s called me a genius to her co-workers, bragged about my speeches to other students….we love each other. I even told my Stanford interviewer about how beautiful she is. No doubt, 1000/10.
Teacher Rec #2: 8. From an AP Lang teacher who knew I was very intelligent, and maybe her top 5 brightest that year, but maybe not a top in her career. I wrote satires she decided to publish in my school’s magazine, and she would support me 100% in Socratic seminars. But, I did get a 3 on her exam, and I wasn’t stellar at English like other students.
Counselor Rec: 8. We love each other, I gave her presents and things, but sometimes I hoped I didn’t offend her (sometimes I accidentally would turn my back on her and then hate myself for it). I think she gave me a glowing recommendation, but she probably did the same for some others too.
Additional Rec: N/A
Interview: My interviewer seemed a bit bored, but at the end she could recall everything I said with precise detail. She definitely did want me to be specific and unique, though, mostly because my answer to every question was something related to human rights and basically nothing else. For those of you who want the exact manuscript of all her questions and all my answers, DM me. I made that immediately after I had the interview.

Reflection
Strengths: Unbridled passion for learning expressed in essays, but because my passion was excessive and everywhere, it could be perceived as try hard and fake.
Weaknesses: My essays were a bit generalized, not extremely unique, and my class rank isn’t stellar (11%).
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected:
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected:
General Comments: Be specific to Stanford. Your best bet is to be unique, but sometimes being unique can still be too broad. If you love fighting climate change, what about it do you love fighting for? Oil spills? Rising sea levels? Then talk about that specific thing in your essays, or use your extracurriculars to specifically do that. There are many people who love climate change, or art, or english, but too many don’t know how to be specific about what makes them blossom and glow with unbridled passion. I loved philosophy and politics, but instead of generalizing to say that “philosophy” or “political science” excites me, I described how fun “iranian contemporary art as a reflection of growing political intellectualism” is. Class rank, GPA, SAT, these are small things that give you a nice edge, but passion and specificity is what truly sends you soaring.
Comments after Rejection: Make sure each essay reveals something new about you, and that your extracurriculars match up with your interests represented in your essays. And be happy.  ",Stanford,2023

Job/Work Experience:
Volunteer/Community service: RED CROSS
Summer Activities: I actually never attended one of those expensive fancy camps, I just attend the Red Cross summer camp as a leader every year
Essays (rating 1-10, details): I think my essays were fairly strong? Common app (8) talked about my fear of being average and how I'm extraordinary, and I think it's funny and self-aware, my supplements I'd rate as a (8) as well. I think they were really unique and reflected my personality, but I could have been more articulate.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): ok I'm totally guessing here because I haven't read any of them
Teacher Rec #1: 8-9?? My french teacher wrote this - I've had her for three years and I even skipped a year of french to take honors french and I always participate in that class and get >97s so I think she really likes me and knows me on a personal level. She has also written a LOR for me for a Red Cross position which I got and for NMSF.
Teacher Rec #2: My APUSH teacher wrote this but I honestly don't know him super well I'd say a 6-7? I did well in his class though and I told him to write about a time where I could have gotten away with an accidental 100% on an FRQ but I didn't. Also I really wanted to help set up for this event that we do every year and I went above and beyond for that. I think this letter reflects more of my honesty and humbleness.
Counselor Rec: ok so my senior class size is HUGE (close to 800) but i've definitely dropped in to talk to my counselor a few times. for recs we had to fill out a bunch of questions so she can write the letter and based off of what i wrote, i think this letter should talk about my creativity, ECs, and my passion for learning. I'd say a solid 7.

Strengths: essays, my first LOR, my ECs are strong but don't relate to my major, my UW gpa is almost perfect
Weaknesses: didn't take AP Lit/Lang, not too many APs which looks bad since my school offers 23, my subject test score for lit (I did get a rllly good essay score on SAT though)
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: i honestly was expecting to get rejected so i'm not too bummed out lol. at the end, it's just hard as a high schooler to KNOW what you wanna major in and have everything geared toward that. my ECs might have been all over the place idk.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: this is my first decision obviously, but I also applied to 5 of the UCs, Cal Poly SLO, USC, Scripps + a bunch of OOS schools mostly on the East Coast (UMich, Cornell, CMU, NYU, BU etc) I applied to more than 20 in total so this rejection is definitely not the only one I'll receive haha

Essays (rating 1-10, details): 9. Honestly my essays were really weird and were kind of atypical of what I would've written to other colleges. I felt like I was writing on par to what an AO would want to hear, but I realized that wasn't my true voice and scrapped the entire roommate essay. This meant I re-wrote the roommate essay the day all apps were due because it didn't sound like me. All other essays were good I would say.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: 10 (Came from my USH teacher whose APUSH study sessions I used to sit in on. She's the one who convinced me to take the AP exam even though I was in the standard class, which paid off. She knew me really well and I think wrote really well about me.)
Teacher Rec #2: 8 (Came from my math teacher. I think that we know each other really well and can really write to my abilities from a STEM stand-point, but I think it might have been weaker when compared to the first rec.
Counselor Rec: 11/10 (Honestly I think this would probably the best part of my application. My counselor knows me extremely well and knows exactly what I want to do and how much I want to do them. I think she knows me the best by now and worked really hard on perfecting a rec letter.
Additional Rec: 9 (This came from the Professor of the lab I work in at the college I do research at. Honestly, I have to work within this lab for long periods of time, so I think that they have really gotten to know my character and work-ethic and wrote to those abilities in the rec letter.)
Interview: 10 (I had an amazing interviewer who liked almost all the same things I did, so the interview went extremely smoothly. Honestly, it felt more like a conversation.)

Essays (rating 1-10, details):
Roommate Essay - 8/10, I think my roommate essay was a pretty good representation of me as a person and I was pretty proud of it, but it's possible the writing style didn't make it stand out as much as it could have.
Intellectual Vitality Essay - 7/10, Probably my weakest essay. I thought the topic was great, but something about it was a little off about it that I couldn't seem to fix. Still good in my opinion, though.
What Matters To You Essay - 10/10, Definitely my best one, I loved the topic (pretty creative in my opinion) and the way I wrote it so I was really proud of this one.
Common App Essay - 9/10, Another one of my favorites that I really enjoyed writing, again I think my topic for this one was pretty creative

Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: 10/10, My junior English teacher loved me and wrote an absolutely glowing recommendation. I was the first student in her career to get an A+ in her class so she wrote a really great letter to reflect that (she let me read it).
Teacher Rec #2: 9/10, My political science teacher also let me read the recommendation he wrote me and it was really good (a few typos, though . . . not sure if that worked against me )
Counselor Rec: 8/10? Not sure, she didn't let me read it but I think she likes me well enough so she probably wrote a decent letter

General Comments:
Although I knew realistically I had a very low chance of acceptance, it kind of ticks me off when I see other people's breakdowns and their, shall I say, 'inferior' profiles. It really shows that it is a crapshoot to get into schools such as Stanford. Also, it did not help me that I was Indian or a male and it may have hurt my application to be totally honest. Overall this is the decision that I expected.
Good luck to everyone who was accepted, rejected, or denied. You all have a place somewhere next year, and I hope that you find it. Just my two cents. ",Stanford,2023

Essays (rating 1-10, details): 7 maybe? My common app essay I felt was pretty good, I wrote it on the story of how I founded my charity, what I’ve done with it, and how it has changed me. For my Stanford specific essays, they were written well, but now that I look back on them I probably would have re-written them.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): Counselor Rec: At least 8/10, I was her favorite student and she even offered to pay for my college apps if I didn’t get a waiver (my family is super poor lol)
Teacher Rec 1, AP Bio: 7/10 I’d guess, her son applied to a bunch of selective schools, so I’d assume she knows how to write a pretty good rec.
Teacher Rec 2, 10th Grade English: 7/10, she was the only english/social studies teacher I really connected with, so that’s why I got a 10th grade teacher for my rec. She was always impressed by my work ethic in class, but I couldn’t read my recs so I don’t know what she wrote about.

I don’t know if I did good or bad? I have anxiety and I think it showed, but he said he’d recommend me for the Stanford band (which he seemed to love) and said some positive things about me, so I hope it was at least neutral.

Reflection:
I feel like instead of submitting my app right away, I should have waited until closer to the deadline so I could have redone some of them when I learnt more about what Stanford looks for in essays.
Strengths: My national award, being a founder of a charity, my volunteer work in general, and a few of my essays.
Weaknesses: My ACT score, I didn’t have AP tests because I’m poor, no SAT subject tests because again, I’m poor and live in an area with no opportunities for these tests.

Essays (rating 1-10, details):
Common App: 8. Tried to avoid a “pity me” but explained the hardships I overcame…
Learning: 7. Felt kinda superficial, I feel like there was something more I could include. Talked about how doing History Day in 9th grade introduced me to research & I fell in love with it.
Extracurricular: 8. I felt the need to explain NJROTC because most people assume its just a recruiting thing, but I learned very important leadership and citizenship lessons there.

Counselor Rec: 9. I talk to my counselor soooo much for school & personal help. I know she was able to elaborate further about the obstacles in my life & how I overcame them to still do everything.
Additional Rec: Didn't submit. Didn’t realize this was an option until too late, because my school uses a dumb third party website for letters of recommendation.

Common app: 0 if possible. Would have been a straight 10, but I sent the common app. essay in at the last sec and forgot to change the college name. Like literally in the last line it says, as I look forward to my future at UT AUSTIN… I realized my blitz three seconds after I sent in the entire app. I hate myself.
Learning: 8/10 wrote about my novel and how all the narrow escapes from death made me excited about the human body and biology and stuff.

Teacher Rec #1: 10/10. English teacher I’m close with. She loves me and writes bomb recs. I never saw the rec, but she’s known for her recommendations.
Teacher Rec #2: 9/10. Also didn’t see this one, but he’s my UIL coach (refer back to the part where I won State Champ. . . yeah.)
Counselor Rec: Probably 3/10. She’s new at her job after our old counselor retired. Doesn’t know me real well, and I didn’t see her rec, but I saw my friend’s (for another school), and. . . let’s just say that grammar and content wasn’t too pretty. I know she’s trying her best tho. . . but. . . 
Additional Rec: N/A
Interview: 4/10. Over the phone. Lots of awkward silence. Little to make a personal connection with omg. I also forgot to mention the fact that my town/school is economically disadvantaged and we have little to NO academic opportunities (hence the lack of APs and IBs). Emailed her (she’d invited me to do so if I wanted her to include anything else in her rec), but she didn’t email back. Idk if she even reported that IMPORTANT fact to Stanford.

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: See above.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Idk yet. Automatic acceptance to UT (lol, it really be like dat @ the blitz), but waiting for acceptance for my major, tho it’s most likely a yes. I’m still applying to two other schools (Rice + Columbia). Wish me luck.

Personal essay (What is engaging) - 7/10 I basically said I enjoy photography and that I am figuring out how to shoot the milky way in a light polluted area and described where, when and how I go through the process.
Excited about learning 3/10- I said I enjoyed instant feedback and I connected it to photography with image preview. I thought this was good when I wrote it but looking back at it...
Future roommate- 7/10 Pretty much gave them my personality, chill, don't like to party, wakes up early, likes sports and photography
Meaningful- 6/10 This one could be hard to follow. I said I like to creatively express myself because CS is so arithmetic. I went through the process of me finding myself and eventually landing on photography. I described the joy i find through photography by describing one of my shoots.

Additional Rec:n/a
Interview: 5/10 My person recently moved back to NorCal so our interview was online. She lived in Birmingham while I live in North AL (2hrs away) so we couldn't have met in the first place. She never really asked me many questions and from what I saw, she barely wrote anything down. I kinda drove the convo for the last 10-15 mins because she would not ask me any questions and it only lasted 22 mins. She had another interview immediately afterward anyway.

This whole process was absolutely nervewracking. Especially the last few days since Stanford has always been my dream school and I began to realize that almost every person who is applying has Stanford as their dream school also. I am very disappointed that I didn't get in but I know that I will still accomplish great things in life. Whether you get in or not, the whole college admission process is a gamble. Admission officers are shown an endless pool of qualified applicants and are forced to choose only a few. Do not let a rejection define your self-worth.

Essays (rating 1-10, details):
Common App: 7.5/10. Wrote about coming out and how it made me more empathetic and helped me see the world from others' perspectives. Pretty good, but I fear it's a lil cliche.
Supplement: 9/10. Pretty good stuff here, I think the essays are really nice at allowing you to talk about diverse aspects of your life. Intellectual vitality one was about exploring my interest in music and engineering via experimenting with my band equipment/recording, which I related to Stanford's music technology major. Roommate essay was about how when I get excited about a topic of discussion, I start talking too loudly and enthusiastically so I need my friends to warn me. The other one was about getting last place in a robotics competition and how it gave me a new appreciation for robotics; somewhat cliche. Short takes were good, albeit a little generic.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: 9/10. US History and Philosophy teacher. He and I have a really good dynamic, several times I've stayed after his class for an hour just to talk about politics/philosophy/baseball.
Teacher Rec #2: 7.5/10. Calc teacher. She and I are pretty chill, but I'm honestly just an above average calc student. I did a pretty impressive project in her class my sophomore year, and she really liked me and my family, but I just have the feeling it wasn't ""glowing hot""
Counselor Rec: ???/10 no idea on this one. Probably generic
Additional Rec: 9/10. My sailing coach and employer who's honestly more of a friend at this point. We've spent a LOT of time together and she knows me really well. I saw this one and it was very well-written.
Interview: 7/10. I'm pretty comfortable in social situations, but it honestly seemed like my interviewer wasn't. 45 minutes of pretty generic stuff.

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected:
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: nowhere yet
General Comments (before decision): I'm pretty proud of myself for what I've done in high school and for the effort I put into the application process. Stanford is AMAZING, so I'll be pretty disappointed if I don't get in, but at the same time, I'm fully expecting to get rejected so I'm bracing for it. I've made mistakes along the way, but I've had a ton of fun as well. I also have an amazing in-state school (UW Madison), so assuming I get in there I'll be fine regardless.
(after decision): I still cannot believe I got in!!! I doubt it'll sink in for a while; this is really a dream come true. I'm obviously very excited, but disappointed because I know exceptionally qualified people that got rejected. I think it's important to keep in mind that ""where you go isn't who you'll be."" My philosophy was to do what I wanted to do and be true to myself, and hope that Stanford liked what I wanted to do. Apparently this worked, but I won't pretend to have any great wisdom.

Weaknesses: Not the highest SAT scores but whatever, probably could have worked harder on the essays to perfect them
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: The students applying REA from my school tend to have major connections (like parents are heads of departments at Stanford), so I think it scares off most other students from applying which may have distinguished me academically. I also have a Stanford legacy and my siblings go there which I think definitely helped an enormous amount
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: nothing yet
General Comments:
If you're applying regular, I would say my biggest regret was not putting in enough effort on the essays. As this thread might show you, there are ample students with perfect GPAs and SAT scores applying, but Stanford isn't able to let all of them in. Your essays are your one real opportunity to distinguish yourself apart from your ""numerical identity."" Just really try your hardest to give creative, unique answers that stand out. Most importantly, be genuine. It is quite easy to see through a student pretending to be someone they are not.
Also, take my application stats with a grain of salt because of my family's relation to Stanford ",Stanford,2023

General Comments:
To future applicants - honestly, calm down and smell the roses. I never even thought I was going to apply to Stanford, and didn’t think about college until my senior year. Take challenging classes, do things you’re interested in, and things will work out in the end! Where you go is not who you’ll be, and it’s perfectly fine to not have been prepping for standardized testing since you were 5 years old (as it seems many people on this crazy forum have been); I literally studied for a month with a $20 prep book, thought I did perfectly fine, and apparently Stanford thought so too :-)

Essays (rating 1-10, details): These are short descriptions of what I wrote about. My essays had a lot more substance with reflection than just these short summaries.
Common App: 8.5/10: It was about my coming out process and what I learned from it and how swimming helped me come to terms with it. I made sure to make it not cliche. It was super personal; however, I don't think it was exceptionally amazing or anything. I think it got my message across and that's all I needed.
Short Takes 9/10: I had so much fun doing these, and I spent a lot of time on them.
Intellectual Vitality Essay 9/10: I wrote about the Senate Program and why I enjoy listening to others speak about their beliefs. Took me a while to write, but I really liked it.
Roommate Essay: 9/10: Wrote about how clumsy I am. I thought it was a good letter.
Meaningful Essay 9.5/10: I wrote about how I gained exposure to issues that I want to help solve by attending a low-income public elementary and middle school. I lived a pretty sheltered life before attending school, so by going to this school, I learned a lot.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: French Teacher 9/10: I never saw it, but I hoped it would be good. I skipped French Level I entirely with no experience my Sophomore year, so I got to know them better because I was always at after school tutoring. They are also the advisor for the MUN club that I founded at my school, so they got to me more through that. Overall, I really liked their class, so I tried hard.
Teacher Rec #2: History Teacher 9/10: I never saw this one either. However, I did really well in their class. I scored high on almost of their exams and asked a lot of questions in class.
Counselor Rec: 10/10: The nicest letter I have ever read; I cried after reading it. They said I was the best student of their career. In a school where each counselor has 400+ students, I think this letter helped me a lot.
Additional Rec: State House Representative that I interned for my Sophomore Year 9.5/10: I read the letter, and it was super nice. It spoke to my passion for public service and working in the government. I think it helped a lot since I want to major in PoliSci.
Interview: 8/10: It was super casual. I naturally enjoy meeting new people, so I didn't feel nervous. The questions weren't hard, and it was done in a coffee shop in my town. The interviewer was super nice, and we spoke for about an hour. Super generic questions. Not sure this helped that much, but I don't think it hurt my application at all

Reflection: I have thought about Stanford all throughout HS. I have seen like every YouTube video ever made about the school. I tried my hardest to increase my chances of admissions by making my application specific towards my major. If you are even thinking of applying, please do it! Just go for it event with a low test score there is always a chance!
Strengths: In the things that I did do, I made sure to be the best I could at them. I started a lot of clubs. I worked super hard on my essays. My letters of rec were super impactful on my application. My GPA.
Weaknesses: Test Scores. However, I studied super hard for the SAT and am content with the 400+ increase that I got. Also, I didn't do anything super extraordinary like start a non-profit or cure cancer. I did a lot of common HS activities that anyone could honestly do if they wanted.
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I put my heart and soul into Stanford. I spent every moment of HS working towards this goal. Overall, I think my essays and letter of rec are what got me in.

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: To be honest, I gave it everything and have pursued activities that use engineering for basically all my free time. I can't really fit anything more into my schedule. To be honest, knew how much luck is involved at this level and I'm at least glad I wasn't rejected outright.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Waiting on Michigan and Berkeley, didn't apply to any other US publics since Canadian schools are way cheaper at about same quality
General Comments: Meh, will see what happens in the regular pool. It would be a dream to go to Stanford but at the same time I know I'll be fine either way.

Extracurriculars: Level 8 piano, lifeguard at local pool, business leadership club member, hosted school events, prom, homecoming, etc unofficially. Won a national level science fair.
Job/Work Experience: McDonald's cashier for 2.5 years. Private piano tutor for 1 year.
Volunteer/Community service: 100+ hours volunteering at local summer camp
Summer Activities: N/A
Essays (rating 1-10, details): I have no idea. 7/10? They were pretty basic.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): I go to a massive public school. As a result, I never got the same teacher more than once. Coupled with the facts that I asked them to start 2 weeks before deadline, didn't provide any brag sheet, and didn't attend any of their clubs leads me to give my overall rating as a 5/10.
Teacher Rec #1: Asked my physics teacher. He's only known me since September 2018. 5/10
Teacher Rec #2: Asked my history teacher. He's only known me since September 2018. 5/10
Counselor Rec: My original counselor of 3 years left my school so this years counsellor was completely new to me. He's quite nice though so maybe 7/10.
Additional Rec: N/A
Interview: Decent. I don't believe the interview actually affected my decision. It was my interviewer asking if I had any questions regarding/about Stanford.

Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): No hooks.
Reflection: Even if you think you have 0 chance, just apply anyways. YOU NEVER KNOW. Being Asian, no hooks, and sub 1400 SAT, I thought I had 0 chance so this was incredibly surprising. As long as you meet the 25th percentile, I think you have a chance. You don't need any national awards, perfect SAT, or anything to be accepted. Luck plays a huge factor in admissions.
Strengths: Everything I had was pretty average imho. Maybe my essays?
Weaknesses: Slightly sub-par SAT score, no hooks, no strong relationships with teachers/GC
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Luck.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Luck.

Essays (rating 1-10, details):
Common App Essay: 9. I was super vulnerable in this. I talked about how my whole life I've been discouraged from going into politics b/c of my race, religion, and gender, and how I began to feel insecure in my own skin. But speech was a source of empowerment for me because I talked about taking charge of my identity and being proud
Intellectual Vitality: 7. I talked about my NPR internship and why I love journalism. But I don't think it was out of this world amazing.
Roommate Essay: 10. I talked about my favorite throwback songs, my love for kdramas, and how fast I can eat a waffle. It was all over the place and very candid. All of my friends said it showed my personality super well too.
What Matters to You: 8. I talked about how going to a diverse high school showed me how real privilege is, and how this made me want to use my voice to speak up about it.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1:8. I know she likes me a lot and she even showed it to me. It was all good stuff and talked about how I'm into social justice. But I'm definitely not like her best student ever or anything. But still very good overall.
Teacher Rec #2: 8. He's known me since freshmen year, we weren't very close when he wrote it but he's seen how I've grown over the years so I'm sure it was good.
Counselor Rec: 9. He knows me personally so I think it must've been good.
Additional Rec: 10. I asked her for one for an optional rec. I'm almost 100% sure she talked about my passion for social justice and she really likes me, although we aren't close. I'm not sure they even read the optional recs though.
Interview: 7. I think it went okay. She wasn't very energetic but she took a whole lot of notes. Our convo kept dying in the middle and we didn't go over time or anything. I think I was one of her first interviews b/c she also seemed kinda nervous. But I didn't feel very confident about it afterwards.

Strengths: recs, essays, my major isn't too popular, courseload, SAT score
Weaknesses: ECs, no major awards, no SAT IIs
Why you think you were accepted: I have no idea. But I wanted my application to highlight my passion for social justice and I think it did that pretty well, and my recs supported that too. I just think my passion must've come across or something. But the main reason must be luck, b/c I really thought I had no chance.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: this is my first decision
General Comments:
So I'm writing this after I've been accepted so I know I might be biased here. But honestly, if you're worried about applying, just do it. I had so many people including my parents telling me I had no chance, and I still have no idea what happened. I didn't have a spike like any major awards or anything but I care a lot about social justice, so I surrounded my whole application around that. I honestly am still freaking out 19 hours later because I really thought I had no chance. This has been my dream school since like forever and I just feel incredibly lucky. But if you're on the fence about applying, I think you should do it, because a small chance is better than no chance at all. ",Stanford,2023

Decision: Accepted
I’m gonna fill this out beforehand and post even when I get my rejection (OMG I GOT ACCEPTED) because I’ve been a silent stalker of these threads for years and only feel like it’s fair to give back.

SAT II: 740 Bio and 700 Chem… yIKES
Unweighted GPA (out of 4.0): 4.0
Weighted GPA: 4.39 (we only weigh AP classes; I took a total of 13 “weighted” courses, including dual enrollment psychology)
Rank (percentile if rank is unavailable): 15/799 (top 2% but only b/c the top 10 are grade grubbers who take every AP online while I grind and grind for my grades… grrr)
AP (place score in parenthesis): Human Geo (5), Biology (4), World History (4), English Lang (4), Chemistry (4), APUSH (5), AP Calc AB (5), French (didn’t take)
Senior Year Course Load: AP Gov, AP Lit, AP Physics 1, AP Calc BC, Scientific Research, Honors Mentorship (internship at clinic)
Major Awards (USAMO, Intel etc.): Nothing major. National Scholastic Gold Key Winner, winner of multiple regional writing competitions, placed 6th at internationals in HOSA event, but nothing crazy
Subjective:
Extracurriculars (place leadership in parenthesis):
-HOSA state officer, served on school team for 2 years, my biggest EC, pour up to 15 hrs/week into it. I’m so thankful for it
-Science National Honor Society (President)
-Research in three different neuroscience labs, published co-author on 2 papers
-Student Council member
-Key Club (secretary)
-Beta Club (project leader)
-Generic honor societies
Job/Work Experience:
-Tutor for my first neuroscience internship for 2 years
-Elementary school science camp counselor
-Intern at pulmonary clinic
Volunteer/Community service:
-This was built into most of my extracurriculars. Ranged from helping w blood drives to elementary school science nights to packaging food, etc.
Summer Activities: research research research  also hosa. also swim team. took a couple summer classes. sounds like not a ton but between hosa and research my summers were p-a-c-k-e-d
Essays (rating 1-10, details): I’m not gonna rate b/c I don’t think that’s helpful at all but I’ll discuss.
-I was really proud of my CommonApp b/c I think it hit on every part of who I am; I talked about merging my interest in creative writing and neuroscience and how I write in an attempt to understand people better. I also used a personal experience to tie into my interest in neuroscience. I felt like it hit on who I am as a friend, a little bit of my background, how I think, and my interest in neuroscience/psych.
-Extracurricular essay: Pretty good. Talked about HOSA
-Short answers: I liked my short answer responses a lot. Probably the best part of my writing.
-Intellectual vitality: talked about a project I did on mass murderers and behavioral health.
-Roommate essay: basically a bunch of random facts about me but I’d like to think it was pretty insightful
-Meaningful to me essay: YIKES this one was hella cheesy. couldn’t think of anything and struggled with this for forever so talked about a community service experience and used a metaphor of having vision lol
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: Biotechnology/healthcare teacher. Probably very high - 9/10?? She can speak really well to who I am as a person (had her for two years) and how I’m really passionate about what I pursue. She’s one of my HOSA advisors and I went to the Dominican Republic with her and our group. Even tho a Stanford admissions officer straight up told me not to submit a biotech rec I made sure my counselor covered that it was an academic and challenging class in her rec. (And hey, it got me in so what can I say??)
Teacher Rec #2: APUSH teacher. she intimidates me but I respect her like crazyy. I have no idea how this rec was (apparently good!!!). She’s my StudCo advisor. She’s an incredibly strong writer which went into my decision to choose her. She knows my work ethic really well and knows I busted my butt in that class but doesn’t know me super well personally so probably a 7??
Counselor Rec: I don’t really know my counselor, she was new last year but she’s very sweet and at least knows who I am, which is more than some students at my school can say. I’m sure it said what it had to but probably pretty impersonal. I’ll go with a 6. Class of 800 leggo
Additional Rec: From my research mentor who I had two publications with and tutored for. Wonderful lady. We got on suuuuper well and she loved me but she’s from France so her writing skills are probably a little iffy. 9?
Interview: Wasn’t offered one

Applied for Financial Aid?: Nope
Intended Major: Psychology
State (if domestic applicant):
Country (if international applicant):
School Type: Suburban public high school
Ethnicity: Indian Asian
Gender: Female
Income Bracket: too high to qualify for FA
Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): anti-hook I’m brown lol
Reflection
Strengths: Extracurriculars, research, leadership, GPA, really focused “spike” in neuroscience (even though I just pursued what I enjoyed)… tbh idk what else. maybe the fact that I really talked about how I wanted to do both STEM and humanities. And essays. I honestly think they're what tied together my app and presented myself as the person I am
Weaknesses: math ACT (the timing got me every flipping time), SAT II, no hooks, not even val or close, upper-middle class brown girl who wants to be premed
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: See above, but honestly I don’t know. I poured my heart and soul into my app and have wanted this since 7th grade.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Accepted at
University of Georgia, University of Alabama Birmingham (first round acceptance in BS/MD program), Union College (first round acceptance in BS/MD program), Augusta University (first round acceptance in BS/MD program). But I'm done with apps - Stanford here I come!!!
General Comments: I still can’t believe this is real. My biggest piece of advice is don't be afraid to be authentically you. I had people tell me I shouldn't apply early because I didn't have a shot. Some told me my scores weren't high enough. Stanford admissions told me not to submit the teacher rec I submitted. Someone who looked over my essays told me that they were too ""story-like"" and didn't deliver strongly enough. I didn't listen. I realized if Stanford didn't want me for who I was, then it wasn't the right fit for me. So I applied the way I wanted to apply, regardless of what other people told me, and it worked.
If you’ve worked your butt off, the results will show it, no matter where you end up:) Congrats to everyone who was accepted, can’t wait to see you in the fall!!!! To those who weren’t, this decision doesn’t define you and you’ll find another school where you’re meant to go. Good luck with the rest of applications!!! ",Stanford,2023

Job/Work Experience: Worked in a water quality laboratory at a top 20 university looking at how meth interacts with wastewater treatment chemicals (IT WAS SO COOOLLLLL) for ten to fifteen hours a week for two years
Volunteer/Community service: Created a nonprofit that was based on the farm in Los Angeles that I grew up on (I adopted about fifteen animals, including a pig). I photograph pets to help make more adoptable, blog about animal issues, and advocate for reform for the teacup pig industry (fun fact: teacup pigs don't exist!).
Summer Activities: Attended Stanford summer engineering institute, worked at a community center and tutored at-risk youth, took a physics class at UCLA that allowed me to skip AP physics 1 and go straight to 2, continued to do research
Essays (rating 1-10, details):
PS (8.5/10)- I wrote about the culture at my school and how it valued boys' educations over girls' (relating it back to a club I formed and the history and actions of the administrators of the school) and how I helped to change it through a lot of fighting and advocating in the community
Short Takes (10/10)- I was so myself, they were really funny and original while also providing insight into some of my goals, accomplishments, etc.
IV (10/10)- I wrote about my research and made it really funny, unique take on science and made it clear that I had a lifelong interest in water sustainability
Roommate (10/10)- I wrote about growing up in different places in America and how I used art to bridge the cultural divide between the places, eventually relating it back to how we could make Stanford a home through art, overall it was quirky and showed a lot about my childhood and ability to overcome obstacles
Meaningful (9/10)- I wrote it about my nonprofit, it was really interesting but was a bit more serious and factual than my others
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: My APUSH teacher (10/10)- I asked him to write one for me and he was so excited about it, telling em that he would do anything he could to get me into Stanford, he wrote mine within three days of me asking when it usually takes him about a month for other people, overall a strong rec from a good writer
Teacher Rec #2: My calc teacher (8/10)- I've had him for two years and he really likes me, but he gets a lot of requests so I'm sure it was a little less personal than my others. Still probably a very strong academic recommendation
Counselor Rec: (10/10)- My counselor loves, and we built a very strong relationship (She told me that I'm one of the strongest students who she's seen in her career)
Additional Rec 1: (9/10)- My research mentor (who just got a PhD from Stanford) wrote me a really good one. He called a meeting with the whole lab and they team wrote it so I'm sure it ended up being pretty strong
Additional Rec 2: (10/10)- My teacher from the Stanford summer program that I attended wrote me one. This was the only one I got to read and it was really good. It was a lot about my personality in the classroom, and I think it helped me have another rec
Interview:
My interview was the first my interviewer had ever done so she was a little bit awkward, but we had a two hour conversation (the restaurant kicked us out bc they were closing so we had to stop lol) after things started to relax

Reflection
Strengths: Essays (!!!!!!!) and recommendations... I think the subjective are a lot more important then pure grades because Stanford gets way too many qualified apps. Another strength would be that my whole app made a lot of sense when looked at as a whole. My intended majors and why I chose Stanford made sense given my essays. I never explicitly talked about why Stanford or why my major, but I worked to make sure it could be inferred pretty easily.
Weaknesses: Subject test scores, SAT score (but my ACT made up for it I think), no hooks
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I was really authentic. I talked about the good and the bad, and I think Stanford appreciated the realness of me. I was definitely not a kid who tailored their life just to get into college.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected:
No where yet but I'm going to apply to four other places
General Comments:
Stanford admissions are crazy, but don't be afraid to apply if it's what you want. I struggled with the decision to apply to Stanford early because the odds seemed absurd, but, at the end of the day, you need to apply where you think you'll fit in. Be yourself. If they don't want you for who you are, it is not the right school for you. Fear the tree and good luck to all future applicants! ",Stanford,2023

Summer Activities:

Essays (rating 1-10, details): 9; I am quite against giving myself a perfect grade, there were, of course, places where I could have improved on my essays (I could do with a few revisions on some word choice), but I think my essays really stood out and were diverse and thorough in my interests.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): 8, I felt pretty confident about my recommendations, my Rec #1 was from a teacher with a fairly good acceptance rate and who famously writes great letters of rec. I was one of her favorite students (I tend to be a favorite among history teachers it seems). My second one I could have found a teacher who I clicked better with, but I hope/think she wrote a good letter (I'll never know). My counselor had a plethora of background to write about me and my interests, and my additional rec was one of my closest/most trusted mentors.
Teacher Rec #1: First teacher recommendation was my teacher for APUSH (which I had my junior year). As stated above, I was one of her favorite students and she would always brag about the work I did to other teachers. She was friends with an alumna of my high school who now attends Harvard (who has been a close friend of mine since I was 8 or 9). Her letter of rec had a bit of a problem, because of Stanford's two-letter limit. My teacher didn't put hers in until the last minute and since Naviance got pushed through with a different teacher, we had to email Stanford, and she had to personally send it to them (which she promptly did, she's the best).
Teacher Rec #2: My second recommendation came from my AP Statistics teacher (who I also had my junior year). This one I was hesitant about, because for the longest time I thought she didn't like me, but I knew I needed a STEM teacher (and I got a B in APES, so you bet I wasn't eager to get a letter from her). But, by the end of the year, I made sure she saw I was engaged with the material (which I was) and I think her letter was pretty good.
Counselor Rec: This is my counselor's second year at the school, so she hasn't known me for *too* long, but she was astounded by all the stuff I had done and I made sure to catch her up on everything I had done (she was maybe a bit overwhelmed when my questionnaire answers were six pages).
Additional Rec: My director at the regional theatre wrote my additional letter of rec. She is prolific and an incredible human being and she has known me since I was 8 years old. She has seen my growth as an actor and a person and she has had a lot of experience writing letters of rec (with acceptances into Stanford/Harvard/etc.).
Interview: My interview was okay. My interviewer apparently had a kid who was going to my school, which was a bit of an oddity, but it made for a good discussion. My interviewer was pretty passive about everything (infamously said that Stanford didn't care what he said--that wasn't the exact wording, but I don't wanna use that language). The more I thought about it, the less confident I felt.

Income Bracket: <need to check back on this one, I forgot; it's higher up there, but I just forgot>
Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): I think my biggest hook was my art and my interdisciplinary passion for political science. I think establishing myself as a writer gave me some ethos, and my essays showed my deep passion for politics and legislation (my experiencing a period of time essay was on the passage of Medicare and Medicaid through Congress). One thing that may have been a hook, despite the Common App trying to thwart me, was my brother's attendance at Stanford. The Common App asks if any family member has ""received a degree"" which I had to answer ""no""-- because he hasn't, but I made sure to let them know that I did have a sibling and had visited the campus many times prior to applying (to show my interest and connection to the school).
Reflection
Strengths: I think I had really strong essays and my going up to audition for the TAPS department really helped show them I had an interest and passion for the school.
Weaknesses: I had low test scores and GPA. It's a weakness of mine. I'm not the perfect student. I wish I was able to achieve a perfect GPA or get a 36 or achieve more than a commendation.
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I like to think I was a good candidate. I had intellectual curiosity and a diverse set of interests, I was passionate about what I did. I don't know any definitive reason, but I am nevertheless grateful they gave me this opportunity.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: This was my first school I have heard back from (we love an REA), so I will have to update this as time progresses.
General Comments: If you are on the fence or in doubt: apply. I know it may seem like this is one of the craziest of super reaches, but if you show a passion and think you would be a good candidate, apply. You never know. You may not have the highest test scores or GPA (I've read some of these and people with much higher GPA's than mine and other good extracurriculars didn't get in), but you just need to show them you. And if they like you, you may find yourself surprised. Go for it. You got it.  ",Stanford,2023

Essays (rating 1-10, details): 9.5, spent a lot of time on them and wrote about things other than my sport like my passion for writing/media. I really think I nailed the 50 word essays
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1:(10+/10). English teacher who I had for 3 years, I was one of his last recs before he retired. Really got along well with him and would stop by his room often to chat about politics and sports, He mailed me a letter over the summer telling me to stay in touch and that he would be following my athletic career on the West Coast.
Teacher Rec #2: (9/10). She was my junior year history teacher and we really got along well despite occasional differences over political ideology. She asked me if I wanted a rec from her before I had even reached out and she was really good about getting my rec done before the end of junior year.
Counselor Rec: (9/10). We got along really well and she had both of my older brothers so she knew my family well. She really understood the athletic recruiting process and helped me out a ton when I missed large chunks of school for traveling and competing.
Additional Rec: No additional recs but I think my recommendations were really good because they were written in the Spring of Junior year when my teachers had less things to do and weren't writing a bunch of other recs like they do in the Fall. It was their first time writing recs that early but it was part of the athletic recruiting process.
Interview: Did not have one. I got my acceptance letter in July and my understanding is that most interviews take place in the Fall so I did not have one.

Strengths: Recruited athlete, essays/recommendations, test scores
Weaknesses: GPA
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I worked really, really hard at school and athletics for many years and it paid off. I fully understand that I would not have gotten into Stanford without my sport, but I also dedicated and sacrificed enormous amounts of time and effort to my sport and Stanford must have taken that into consideration.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I did not formally apply anywhere else but I received positive pre-reads at Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and some other big public schools
General Comments: Athletes are people too. ",Stanford,2023

Unweighted GPA (out of 4.0): 4.0

Summer Activities: Work, Volunteering
Essays (rating 1-10, details):
8/10 Common App: Wrote about my move from India my freshman year, and how I joined the water polo and swim teams and found my place. Tried to steer away from cliches of being sad or having a jock story. Just described my first week of practice, and how that was super hard and how staying with it showed different aspects of my personality.
9/10 Supplement: Wrote pretty witty answers that I thought showed various aspects of my behavior. Humor and the fun side, but also a thoughtful and dedicated person.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: 9/10 English teacher who was in awe of me. He was an extremely good writer so I'm sure he made his letter like a work of art.
Teacher Rec #2: 9/10 Physics teacher. He was super chill and a great teacher and friend. I used to love talking to him about physics stuff and he knew I wanted to major in astrophysics too so I'm sure he wrote about that.
Counselor Rec: 6/10 He knew that I was a great student and everything, but I don't think it would have been very personal. I hadn't really put in the time or effort to get to know him or even talk to him much.
Additional Rec:
Interview: 8/10 Came off as very passionate about the college and knew what I was talking about in terms of both Stanford, astrophysics and how the two came together.

Reflection:
Strengths: Great test scores, GPA, extracurriculars, and volunteering.
Weaknesses: Maybe my essays or rec letters, although I don't think it was that.
Why you think you were rejected: Like 7 or 8 people applied from our school, and as an almost steadfast rule, only one gets in. I thought it was going to be me, but other people had some other factors *cough cough race cough* on their side. Maybe even despite the extracurriculars and roundedness that I tried to display, they still thought I didn't have anything super significant like a research paper or something.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected:
Have applied to UW, UCSB, UCLA, UC Berkeley, Harvard, Princeton, MIT, Johns Hopkins, Dartmouth, Columbia, UChicago. Waiting to hear back, but in my mind I'm going to UW (my safety), and if I get in anywhere else that's an upgrade...
General Comments: I literally made this profile for just this post, to get this off my chest and hopefully show through comparisons, how the admissions process is effectively just luck once you reach an acceptance rate <10%. Hopefully, all of you great people keep in mind that a rejection from Stanford is an acceptance for some other college, and that other college will be happy to have you. It's Stanford's loss.

Thought I could have been more specific when explaining why Stanford specifically, but I think I made up for it in the interview.

common app essay: 7/8 I talked about my relation to television and how it has shaped me into who I am today. I liked
it since it's a more unique essay compared to my other drafts for my common app essay
roommate: 6/7 i mean it was alright, it was a normal essay. there was some snark and personality in it
meaningful: 7 the people I showed it to really liked it and thought it was a good representation of me. I talked about
my relationship to art and how it helped me to become more confident in myself even with my imperfections
intellectual vitality: 8 i honestly loved this essay. it was about how when i was young i had to build my own computer
as a punishment for breaking the family computer and how it taught me how to persevere through challenges and
discipline.

Job/Work Experience: I've worked at McDonald's for two years.
Volunteer/Community service: A lot of my extracurriculars had volunteer work as part of the organization, so I didn't do much on my own.
Summer Activities: The summer before my Junior year I worked a lot and the summer before my Senior Year I took part in a 6-week summer program at UNC-Chapel Hill centered around diversity. We conducted our own research, took an English Class for credit, and stayed in a dorm (honestly, the most fun 6 weeks of my life).
Essays (rating 1-10, details):
Common App- I would give an 8 or 9. It revolved around my being a gay student in a very conservative Catholic School and how my self-loathing started to affect how I treat others around me. Talked about how I was forced to grow to not care about what people think about me, while still disclosing how little self-confidence I have as a result of my upbringing.
Intellectual Vitality Essay: I would give a 7 or 8. It wasn't amazing, but I feel like it was somewhat unique as I talked about how music has inspired me to learn more about the world around me. In specific, I talked about how Clean Bandit's "" Rather Be"" got me into playing Violin and later Viola, and how Celine Dion's ""Ne partez pas sans moi"" and Gfriend's ""Rough"" got me to start learning French and Korean, respectively.
Roommate Essay: I would give this a 10. It honestly was just me having fun with the prompt and talking about how I listen to so much KPOP to the point that my roommate may find me at 2 AM reacting to the latest video releases. I also delved deeper into my language learning and how I will be practicing a lot during my free time.
Meaningful to Me Essay: I would give it a 9. I talked about my mom and how important my Colombian Heritage is to me as a person, how my knowing Spanish has allowed me to help my mom who doesn't know English, and influenced my love of hugs.
Short Answers: My short answers I feel were really unique and I just had fun with them. I would give them an 8-10.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: 10/10. My Sophomore and Junior Year Chemistry Teacher who I have a really good relationship with. I talk to her almost every day after school and she even asked me to play at her wedding.
Teacher Rec #2: 8/10. My French Teacher who I've had for 3 years. I'm not as close with her, but she definitely wrote me a good recommendation.
Counselor Rec: 8/10. We are pretty close and I know she took her time to write a really good one. I know she wrote about my being gay and my situation with that at home (I turned in a sheet with a bunch of information about myself).
Additional Rec: N/A
Interview: 10/10. This interview went so well. We talked about so much ranging from Korean History to the influence of AAVE on the gay community. At the end, he more or less told me he thinks I should get in, which made me feel really good about my chances.

Stanford had been my dream since middle school. I did not apply early to Stanford because I decided I would rather apply to a need-blind institution (Harvard) early action and not risk my chances merely due to my financial situation as an international student. I was beyond content with getting into Harvard, and honestly, this came as a huge shock to me. I was not expecting to get into Stanford asking them for that much money. I'm happy beyond words. Euphoric, ecstatic, elated, idk, you say it!! This is UNBELIEVABLE.
P. S. the results came out at 3:30 AM in my timezone and I just want to say this: to all my friends and family who stayed up all night to support me through this, I'm thankful for every single one of you!

Major Awards (USAMO, Intel etc.): Nothing really -- qualified for AIME, attended but didn't do that well at HMMT, placed well in some state/national tournaments prestigious within my country. Lots of smaller awards (within school, etc.) and did some more impressive stuff as a middle schooler (which you'd find if you googled me, but I didn't mention in my apps)Subjective:
Extracurriculars: Classics Club president (huge commitment), trivia team captain (we're one of the best in the country), Ancient Greek student, physics research group (not that impressive, we're pretty bad), running some small things at my school, writing for the school magazine, playing piano recreationally (I'm not good at all)
Job/Work Experience: A short gig doing some programming for a small corporate client a couple summers ago -- nothing much
Volunteer/Community service: About 60 hours of assorted stuff from volunteering with school or spring break camps, etc.; another ~100 hours volunteering with Habitat for Humanity (every other weekend)
Summer Activities: Some nothing, some travelling with family; took a bunch of online comp sci classes. In addition, I'd usually either do some sort of academic camp or plan some academic activities for myself -- stuff that you have to be smart to get into, but nothing impressive
Essays: Honestly, rating your own essays is a struggle. I'm a really good writer, and my guidance counselor who is relatively competent approved them, so they can't be that bad. Wrote my common app about a large building project I designed (not like house-size, like lifesize diorama). My essays were mostly about some nerdy stuff and some existential stuff (now you basically know everything you need to know about me XD), and I think compared to the other schools I applied to, my Stanford essays were particularly interesting, deep/compelling, and well-written.Recommendations
Teacher Rec (STEM): Teacher I had in sophomore year and this year. I saw the rec and it was pretty good -- said I was one of the strongest students she's ever taught and also mentioned a lot of really strong personal leadership qualities.
Teacher Rec (Humanities): Teacher I had last year. I had a good combo of aptitude and dedication in his class and was one of the few who did; got a good grade and he expressed that he had a lot of respect for me. I've been working with him closely this year because he's the trivia team supervisor; he's displayed a lot of awe at my leadership/organization skills, which are extremely good, so I think it was probably a pretty strong rec.
Counselor Rec: My counselor definitely sees me as one of the most passionate and mature students in my grade, but he doesn't know me that well. It was probably OK, but not necessarily above the average good rec.
Additional Rec: My online computer science teacher I've known since sixth grade. He thinks I'm absolutely incredible and a genius so I think this rec will be good.
Interview: Didn't get one (and most people who applied at my school did)Other

Income Bracket: 200kish
Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): URMReflection
Strengths: I think Classics+Engineering is a pretty interesting/unique combo and my common app essay made it clear how I want to combine the two. I'm pretty intelligent (davidson institute-level, if you know what that is), but I honestly don't know how common that is -- maybe it makes me stand out, maybe it's a dime a dozen. Also not sure how much my hooks help. I definitely have a unique worldview and I'm super passionate/intellectual/driven/organized; if those things came through in my application, I bet they helped.
Weaknesses: I have a bunch of small-to-medium awards but none of the golden tickets like USAMO, etc., and haven't done anything super exciting or innovative -- nothing that makes you think, we need that kid. I'm not a fancy entrepreneur or anything, I just love and am very good at learning.

General Comments:
Stanford 2022. I truly believe my three short essays are what got me in and in hopes of providing insight to prospective Stanford students, here are my essays:
Idea or experience that makes you excited about learning:
My first time walking into Starbucks was a peculiar experience that I will never forget. Not because I was
immediately pummeled by the repugnant smell of iced lattes being made, but due to what I first noticed: Apple.
Phones, tablets, computers, all branded with the same simplistic logo. I felt as if I was an extra-terrestrial in a
foreign universe dominated by one singular power. It was at that moment, I experienced a brilliant epiphany. I
realized my true calling in this world. It was my entrepreneurial big bang. I realized that I wanted to propagate my
own simplistic logo across the globe. From then on, I yearned to learn all the vast idiosyncratic elements that
composed the periodic table of business. Suddenly, my mind began to race. I began to look at the world through a
different lens. I felt as if I was David Hume questioning every single component of my surroundings. I pondered as
to why Starbucks opened at 5:00 in the morning, why did they utilize a mermaid as their logo, what led to the
name ‘Starbucks’. I was deeply fascinated by the various cogs in the Starbucks machine. From the operations and
financials to the marketing and sales, I was compelled by all the bits and pieces that made Starbucks the societal
staple that it had become. I walked into that Starbucks skeptical of how good a cappuccino was. I walked out
having fallen in love with business.
Note to future roommate:
Hey there! If you’re reading this, then it probably means I slept in again. (Had to finish binge-watching House of
Cards). Don’t worry, I promise I won’t be late to class. I just wanted to thank you for being the best roommate I
could ask for. I thought you would’ve been weirded out by me listening to Adele while I studied, but it was
refreshing to know you enjoyed her enchanting voice as well. I mean who doesn’t love Adele? I was thinking of
having an Insidious movie marathon and I was wondering if you’d be interested? Also, I had the weirdest dream
last night. I wish I could tell you, but I’ve already forgotten most of it, but trust me, it was insane. I have got to tell
you about this awesome idea for an app I came up with. It’s basically an interactive calendar that rewards you for
completing tasks throughout the day. I’m not sure how it would know you completed the tasks or what the rewards
would be, but I was thinking about calling it Calenda-rewards. The name still needs work, but this could be the
next big thing. Anyways, I’m going to play some ultimate frisbee. See you later!
-Rodney (Feel free to call me Rod or the Monopoly G.O.A.T.)
P.S. Should I eat breakfast tomorrow at Lakeside or Wilbur? I could really go for an omelet.
P.S. #2 You should totally check out City of God on Netflix. It’s a thrilling movie. 10/10
Something meaningful to you and why:
The Robin to my Batman, the Chewbacca to my Han Solo, I couldn’t imagine my life without my BIC pen. I wake
up at 6:00 a.m. red-eyed and drowsy. I immediately grab my BIC pen and begin my day’s work. I write down what I
dreamt of hoping to figure out if there is some subconscious pattern. Soon after, I grab a post-it note and write
down my to-do list: do laundry, finish summary for philosophy, prepare persuasive speech. I then head to class. As
my professor speedily rambles through Crito, I frantically write down notes in order to have some recollection of
the day’s class. I stop mid-lecture and grab another post-it note. I write down my ideas for the upcoming Pi day
event to present at the next math club meeting. In between classes, I write down the quotes of various penny
stocks I’ve been scouting. After school, I head to the Center for Academic Success. The scene is beyond hectic.
As we near finals, many students seek to review material. I sign-in, grab my BIC pen and begin to work out
problem sets with students. After my shift is done, I head home. A light bulb bulges above my head and I instantly
grab my BIC pen and write down my idea for a steering wheel that detects if the driver is drunk. I get home, finish
my to-do list, and head to bed. Always there when I’m in need, my BIC pen is my trusty sidekick. ",Stanford,2022

Reflection
Strengths: I feel that my application was very personal. I explained what I'm interested in and showed the admission officers what I thought about and how. My scores were good enough and somehow my extracurriculars tied in with what I wrote about.
Weaknesses: Lacking in leadership positions and my grades are a bit low compared to what I could've done... oh well... that's what I get for not caring about college until the end of junior year.
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I was me. I probably seemed ambitious in my essays. Also, not applying to anything engineering related (especially CS) (not that I'm interested in that, but I've seen all the top students at my school who want to be engineers get rejected by top universities).
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: ACCEPTED: OSU, UCLA, Georgetown, Dartmouth
WAITLISTED: Cornell, UC Berkeley
REJECTED: Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Columbia, UPenn, Brown, UChicago
Final note: This will sound cheesy but don't worry about what you think colleges care about. If you do activities because you think colleges care about them (looking at you, NHS) and not because you care about these activities (ahem NHS), then you're doing it wrong. Do things you love and if you do them well enough, you will be recognized and awarded (but don't chase recognition either! If you can't be recognized one way, oftentimes there will be many other ways which come to you.) Write about things you care about. Don't try to write yourself into a doctor if you don't even care about anatomy (hypothetical example). Find yourself and write about yourself.
Here's a long-winded personal anecdote about just that and how it is important (feel free to skip if you know yourself):
For the longest time, I thought that I was destined to be the next big TECH MOGUL (I swear I thought this until the beginning of Junior Year... I was a dang fool). So I yearned to go to Stanford. I denied that I was really more of a social sciences/geography type person (despite the fact that I had way more achievements in these fields). Thankfully, my parents never really pushed me to learn code, do engineering or doctor stuff, or anything that I wouldn't really like to do. In fact, my dad knew I really wasn't into computers and tech because I couldn't bother to make myself learn code, and whenever I was given the opportunity, I simply brushed it off. Fortunately, I came to my senses during Junior Year. I wrote instead about what I truly cared about (social sciences and how humans interact with the Earth). If I didn't, I am 100% sure the admissions people would be able to tell. I was a bit too witty and not focused on myself enough on my UChicago essay and as a result, (although it was quite witty), the essay probably didn't do me much good.
NOTE: if you truly care about technology or being a doctor or being witty or anything really, go ahead and write about that. I'm not in the business of crushing people's dreams. That's what selective college admissions is here to do.
And don't be afraid to apply (and, if you don't have the money, find ways to get fee waivers)! You might not think you're the most impressive person ever and may get rejected by a lot of colleges (ME), but it just might be worth your time! ",Stanford,2022

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: strong hook in CS and good essays
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Accepted at state schools, NYU, Yale, Penn, and Brown; Rejected at Cornell and Columbia; Waitlisted: Harvard
General Comments: College is a crapshoot! Make sure you are very talented in one or two areas and that this makes a theme, also show you are accomplished in this area through large national/international level recognition! Write good essays that show something about the way you think but also know essays aren't everything - I spent like no more than a few hours for each school! ",Stanford,2022

Rant/Takeaways.
Yeah, it's disappointing, I (stupidly) thought there was no way I'd be rejected, but since I didn't dedicate my formative years to scientific research or traveling to build mud huts in Africa I didn't get in. Probably shouldn't be writing this so soon after seeing decision, but whatever, I'm venting. I thought that my success in sports and my rigorous class load nd successes would get me in. Anyway, advice from my English teacher: You should be incredibly thankful for any school that denies you. By denying you they are sparing you from getting to campus and realizing you cannot fit in or succeed, spending thousands in the process. Sounded better when she said it, but I hope it helps any of you feeling how I am right now. ",Stanford,2022

Major Awards (USAMO, Intel etc.): Wouldn't call it ""MAJOR"" major, but 1st place for Wisconsin State Japan Bowl and 8th place at National Japan Bowl in DC
Subjective:
Extracurriculars (place leadership in parenthesis): Youth Leadership Intern at Concordia Language Villages' Japanese Camp, State+National Japan Bowl, School trip to Japan, Credit villager and two week villager at CLV Japanese camp, 7 years of martial arts, 8 years of curling, Varsity cross country all years of HS, Amnesty International (Leader in senior year), Hospital volunteering, and work at a fast food place
Job/Work Experience: Intern at Language villages (Immersion camp, so I was there working all day for 5 weeks straight. It's a language immersion camp in Minnesota), job at fast food restaurant
Volunteer/Community service: Hospital volunteering (roughly 90 hours?)
Summer Activities: Intern at language villages, camper at language villages, martial arts, fast food work, trip to Japan
Essays (rating 1-10, details): Common app: 9/10. It was about meeting a friend in Japan after two years of not seeing her and it talked about how it taught me to strengthen connections with those in my life. I thought it was quite good.
Intellectual vitality: 7.5-8/10: It was fairly unique and it talked about how I find human intelligence amazing and how it makes me stop and wonder sometimes. Well-written, could have done something more personal though.
Roommate letter: 8.5/10: It got across my tone and personality really well, but didn't talk all that specifically about me as a person. It sounded sarcastic, which was what I wanted, but I don't think it was too heavy.
Meaningful to me: 7/10: Wrote it about martial arts. Not necessarily bad content but I think it was too repetitive and it wasn't personal enough to my story.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: 9.5/10 (?): My chemistry teacher. I'm easily her favorite student and I excel in her class.
Teacher Rec #2: 9/10: My history teacher. I'm not his favorite or anything but he's had me for a while, I do really good work and try really hard, and he's seen me mature as a student.
Counselor Rec: 6/10: Reason for the low rating is that he's new this year and he just doesn't really know me or any other student that well.
Additional Rec: 10/10: From my employer at Concordia Language Villages. She likes me a lot and she's very friendly so
Interview: 9/10: Thought it went really well. Lasted a bit over an hour and I walked out of there thinking I nailed it.

Applied for Financial Aid?: No
Intended Major: Put down Chemistry, East Asian Studies, Biology
State (if domestic applicant): Wisconsin
Country (if international applicant):
School Type: TINY private school (pre-k through 12 and we have less than 500 students)
Ethnicity: White
Gender: Male
Income Bracket: Not stated
Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): None
Reflection
Strengths: Test scores, rigor of classwork, and I thought I demonstrated a love for Japanese and showed how I was actively involved in it. Also my ECs were pretty unique in the realm of Japanese and they likely seemed pretty genuine
Weaknesses: Lack of any major national awards, not a lot of STEM-related content on my application, some ECs were pretty mediocre
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: At the end of the day, it's impossible to say for sure. If I had to take a guess, it would be that I didn't write essays that were compelling enough for them to want to let me in. I write in a pretty formal and academic tone and I wonder if I should have deviated from that slightly because I ended up sounding a little bit emotionless, probably...and then there was also how some extracurriculars just didn't show that much commitment.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Nowhere yet.
General Comments: I thought I was gonna be more upset if I got rejected than I actually am right now. I'm proud of the effort that I put into my application and my activities, and honestly, there are definitely people out there who are much more committed to going to Stanford and deserve it more than I do. I now have a chance to revise my application for the other schools I'm applying to and perfect those essays and learn from not spending enough time on the writing for Stanford. Don't let it get you down too much. Nothing changes about you as a person whether you get accepted, deferred, or rejected. Be proud of being confident and putting yourself out there. You make yourself who you are and you determine if you're going to be successful or not, not the school that you go to. Just be happy with yourself. ",Stanford,2022

Job/Work Experience: I’ve babysat since 6th grade, worked as a counselor at an elementary after-school program, and am a sales associate
Volunteer/Community service: food banks for the past 2 years, assistant coached a basketball team for freshman and sophomore year
Summer Activities: nurse camp 2016, Stanford High School Summer College 2017
Essays (rating 1-10, details): Common App (8/10) - Honestly I’m harsh on my own writing but I started working on this months before Common App even opened so it was heavily edited and worked on. I wrote about something I’m extremely passionate about (who doesn’t) and that is also a huge part of my life. I thought it helped explain a lot about me as a person because it showed many different sides to me and also showed something I want to work on in the future.
Intellectual Vitality one that isn’t actually called that anymore (9/10) - I used my essay that got me into HSSC for this, just edited. I talked about a job shadow I had done that I was originally disinterested in but gradually wanted to learn more about. Kinda basic, but I put some humor into it.
Roommate (10/10) - Very casual and jokey but mentioned what I learned during my time on campus and how I was looking forward to getting to show my roommate what I knew and explore new things with her.
Meaningful (8/10) - Wrote about my sister. Very overused trope, but talked about some personal things like my parent’s divorce and how I had to grow up at a young age for her.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: 10/10 - This is the teacher I had write my rec for Stanford HSSC last year, and since I got accepted there, I figured she had positive things to say about me. I also had a great relationship with her when I took her class and still am in contact with her this year.
Teacher Rec #2: 10/10 - This teacher I had twice so he knows me well. He mentioned to me he talked about some of my interests that give me strengths, that I also emphasized in my essays.
Counselor Rec: 8/10 - My school is huge so my counselor doesn’t know most kids but I’ve talked to him a few times more than the average kid at my school. He does know about some extenuating circumstances I dealt with in these past 4 years and asked me if it was okay to mention those, so admissions got more of a perspective into my life at my school.
Additional Rec: none
Interview: 9/10 - My interviewer was amazing. She had attended Stanford for law school and Yale for undergrad, which was a bit intimidating, but she seemed truly interested in what I had to say. We related on a few things like where we thought about/are thinking about attending school, and she mentioned she thought Stanford was a good fit for me and for what I want to do with my life (although that was nice I didn’t hold much weight to that bc “interviews don’t do much”).

Reflection
Strengths: Test scores, essays, having attended HSSC and having Stanford credits under my belt
Weaknesses: GPA, my essays somewhat
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Stanford is very selective so I'm trying to tell myself that's part of it, but honestly my GPA. I struggled with a lot throughout high school which caused me to get some B's that screwed up my freshman year 4.0. I talked about that in my application, but from stats, it looks like Stanford just doesn't like Bs.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Accepted - Washington State University, and then we’ll see about the rest in March
General Comments: It's not the end of the world. Stanford honestly wasn't my top choice but was the only school that had an early program that I'm applying to, so I took a shot. I was sad when I opened the update, sure, but I realized that I wasn't meant to be there and I couldn't really imagine myself being there. Hopefully, my top choice is where I'm really meant to be, and I'm not gonna beat myself up over it. Anyone reading this who hopes to be accepted, or was rejected as well, don't be mad at yourself.

Essays (rating 1-10, details): 8 overall, Common App essay about my revelation on sunrise hike to Silver Peak mainly surrounding my life purpose and helping others (maybe too much vivid imagery not enough talking about myself?), quirky and personal roommate letter, details on my ventures in the world of jazz violin (yes it's a world), a general emphasis on creativity and empathy

Teacher Rec #1: 10, my History teacher, very personal, glowing rec

Reflection
Strengths: meaningful range of extra curriculars, test scores, sense of self, altruism
Weaknesses: No SAT II's or a real hook
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: None of my rec's were from science or math departments even though I applied to an engineering major. I realized short after submitting that my alternate major was my first choice and I should have gotten my science teacher to write a letter of rec. As I mentioned, I also didn't submit any SAT II tests, which might leave me unqualified for engineering. My very sincere aspirations to make the world a better place might have come off the wrong way
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Didn't apply anywhere else early
General Comments: I'm surprised that I was not upset at by this denial, I guess that's what happens when you have a ton of schools you love. Congrats to those who were accepted and everyone here should be proud of themselves regardless of admissions decisions!!! ",Stanford,2022

What excites you: 8/10. I talked about developments in AI. I'm super mad about this one because Google's AlphaZero just thrashed Stockfish at chess like three days ago and that would've been the perfect topic for me to write about.
Wasn't bad but not as passionate as I would've liked (thanks Deepmind, for being a month too slow)
Roommate letter: 9.5/10 because perfection is a human construct. Lol seriously though I was really happy about this one. I think I managed to capture my enthusiasm and somewhat quirky humor really well with this one.
Meaningful: 9/10 maybe a bit cliched? I think it was still written well though. I talked about how the small gestures of helping others add up, but in context of my own daily life.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1:10/10. AP Lang teacher. I'm a pretty good writer. She gave me the book award for my class. 'nuff said
Teacher Rec #2: 10/10. AP Bio teacher. Also destroyed that class (never below a 97 on a test, really tryhard on projects, etc.) In general pretty strong relationship with both teachers
Counselor Rec: 10/10. One of the top students at a small school. He said verbatim that my rec was one of the most enjoyable to write all year.
Additional Rec: Band director 10/10. I'm one of those band geeks. One of 3 students in his Music Theory class this year. Busted my ass volunteering for the band. Got last year's Citizenship award.

Reflection
Strengths: Really solid rec letters, a few leadership positions and decent essays
Weaknesses: no hooks, no AIME/USAMO/ISEF or whatever. I didn't specialize because I genuinely love all my subjects and now I'm getting punished for it. Also, AP scores. I wrote a whole rant about my three 4s and then reconsidered, but TL;DR shouldn't have gotten only 4s but oh well too bad.
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: no hooks or major national awards like ISEF. Stanford compsci is super competitive. If we really wanna get cynical, also refer back to my gender and ethnicity

Strengths: test scores, gpa was solid, I thought that my essays were good but maybe not, rec letters

Why you think you were rejected: Since I was at the top in terms of mere statistics, I would say the weakness of extracurriculars. There's definitely 1700 people who have stronger activities and more accomplishments.

General Comments: I regret nothing. I took advantage of every opportunity that I had/had been aware of at the proper times. I had absolute control over nothing but myself, and I did the best that I could. I was very honest and genuine in my application, and if Stanford didn't think it was a good enough fit then it wasn't a good enough fit, and I know that I will be okay without them.

Strengths: Extracurriculars for sure. Mine were unique and I was good at them.
Weaknesses: Class rank, some of my recs may have been generic (I didn’t get to read all of them), not a ton of service hours, race, scores weren’t fantastic.
Why you think you were rejected: Honestly I think that it’s mostly just because there’s only so many spots and there are so many qualified applicants. Oh and I’m a privileged white male. Also perhaps my recs and essays could have been a bit better, though I personally liked my essays. Oh and 9 other people from my school applied REA (idk if any of them got in; I’ll have to wait and see).
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: accepted to University of Oregon but that’s not very hard lol
General Comments: I gave it my best effort. Congrats to everyone who got in! You totally deserve it. And to everyone like me who got rejected, many of us deserved to get in too, but not everything can always turn out how we want it. Stanford was easily my top choice, but I know I’ll be happy wherever I end up. I hope this helps some people! And good luck to all the RD applicants. I’ll definitely apply to Stanford for law school and I’ll give it my best shot then. ",Stanford,2022

Essays (rating 1-10, details): 8.5, spent forever on it, used the takeoff and landing of an airplane as a metaphor for my curiosity in other people’s stories bc of my own cultural heritage
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): 8, I didn’t really ask teachers in the classes I did the best in, but collectively they told an important story
Teacher Rec #1: Honors Pre-calculus, i had just come from a semester abroad/away where I didn’t do a lot of math, so I was a semester behind. The teacher told me to drop the class and go to regular bc it would be easier for me. I started with a D in the class. But I didn’t follow his advice, and by the end of the semester I was doing extremely well, actually one of the strongest in the class, so I was really proud of myself
Teacher Rec #2: Honors french, incredible guy, he also used to teach my dad at a different school back in the day, languages are my hidden passion.
Counselor Rec: my counselor is a literal angel, I love her so much. She has been absolutely instrumental in this whole experience
Additional Rec: Head master from the school I attended when I was away for a semester. It was a fine arts and philosophy oriented boarding school. Incredible experience that I’m so grateful for.
Interview: AMAZING, the women who interviewed me was wonderful and she was extremely kind and told me that I had a good shot and that she was impressed. I’m so grateful for her as well.

Why you think you were accepted: I honestly think my passion towards the creative arts shone through, my heart and soul was in that application and I honestly think I was able to highlight some amazing qualities. I think my focus on fine art let me achieve some unique things that have been so unexpected for me, but helped a lot. Everything I did I have been doing for all the years of high school. Also for my Intel ISEF project I did research with Stanford and Georgia Tech’s biological sciences labs to find an alternative cure for cancer (sounds outlandish but I wrote about this for one of my essays as a way to show personality and grit) I think that helped a lot too.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: no where yet!!
General Comments: everything I did, I did because I truly loved it, never did I have college admissions in mind. I think because of this my passions spoke for themselves.

Strengths: Legacy, military kid, maybe the business???, good scores on both SAT and ACT (I’m just making up stuff to try to make myself look better now lmao)
Weaknesses: no major awards, not too much leadership, essays were probably not interesting enough, maybe they think my business isn’t brainy or intelligent enough(??), also didn’t put my AP Scores down…. But I included AP Scholar and AP Scholar with Honor and one of my teacher recs mentioned the 4 and 5 that I got on his exams so idk if that made up for a little of it.
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected:
Maybe legacy, military kid?? My business probably had an impact, and my essays were pretty unique even though I faulted them after the fact for not showing enough of my personality. Wrote about some pretty deep stuff (see above) and didn’t try to adjust like I was writing to older people like most people probably did.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected:
Nowhere yet, applied to UVA, Purdue, Georgia Tech, and UC Berkeley, and will apply to UPenn
General Comments:
SO EXCITED!!!! This has been my dream school since I could walk, and I thought there was absolutely no way in any alternate universe I would get in. I’m so excited to be at the Barn next year!
Advice: Develop great relationships with your teachers, have a few interesting ECs but one specifically that you REALLY put a lot of time into, and MAKE YOUR ESSAYS INTERESTING. A trend I saw throughout my college applications is that when I had them checked by others and changed them around a little bit, they lost my voice and excitement and more sounded like they were coming from boring adults (sorry Mom). It’s always good to have a proofreader, but use words and silly phrases that YOU would use, not your parents. Stanford is getting adult words from every application, so be interesting and funny and GO OUT ON A LIMB WITH WHAT YOU SAY. Don’t be like everyone else. This is the best advice I can give.
Congrats to all who got in, and for those who didn’t, you will THRIVE at another school. It wasn’t meant to be!!! God doesn’t make mistakes y’all! Love you guys. ",Stanford,2022

Even though I started my application relatively early, I felt like I barely had enough time (I submitted my application on Halloween 10/31) as the deadline approached. Good luck to future applicants!

Reflection
Strengths: My essays definitely. I fell like they conveyed who i was a lot better than my tests or classes, however i have been fully dual enrolled since the sumemr after sophmore year.
Weaknesses:Transcript and tests. My physics subject was way lower than most who send them. My transcript also had 3 B's on it, one in a semester of Chem, one in DE calculus 1, and one in DE physics 1.
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I think Stanford was able to see me in my essays, while some people write about what they think Stanford wants, i wrote about what i wanted. Not everything was academically focused and i didnt repeat anything that was somewhere else in my application (except the ectra curricular essay. I talked about TSA but it was something not shown on the common app.)
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected:Deferred from University of Georgia EA, havent applied elsewhere

Writing (Subject, 1-10 rating, details):
Essays:
- Common App Essay: 9/10. My essay was very vulnerable without trying to milk pity. Result was very honest,
emotive and well put together.
- Stanford Supplements: 8-9/10. I decided to unleash my quirkiness w/o becoming gimmicky. These essays were
original (in my acceptance letter they described that I was a very unique and original individual). In the roommate essay I compared my personality to all the different ways once can fry eggs.
Teacher Recommendation #1:Junior year IB English teacher. I had an amazing teacher-student relationship with her, (I'm quite endearing to her) and I know the letter was glowing. (9/10)
Teacher Recommendation #2: Junior year AP Euro teacher. My most favorite teacher I've had (might be in a 3-way tie), we commiserated a ton over politics and history. Knowing my love and aptitude for subject, the letter was most likely full of praise. (9/10)
Counselor Rec: Actually got to sit down with my counselor for an hour the day app was due to talk about me. My counselor knows me very well (IB get their own counselor), meaning the letter was probably quite detailed.
Additional Info/Rec: IB Visual Arts teacher. This one I actually did get to read, and it was amazing. She's a neighbor of mine, actually, and she included lots of flattering details (including the fact she bought a work of mine at ""market"" price). (10/10)
Interview: Interviewed by a delightful hand specialist surgeon. We hit it off quite well (he went to my elementary, his son started my HS's pride club). Talked in a library cafe for 3 hours. The interview was amazing. (9/10)
Art Supplement: Not submitted (could have, decided not to)
Other
Date Submitted App: 10/31/2017
U.S. State/Territory or Country: Utah (SLC)
School Type: Suburban Public School (2000 students); unofficial magnet due to IB program there; competitive
Ethnicity: White
Gender: Male
Income Bracket Range: Lower/Middle Middle Class
Hooks (URM, first generation, recruited athelete, development): Secondary legacy (aunt, uncle, and cousins), LGBT
Reflection
Strengths: Essays, letters of recommendation, UW GPA, coursework level, interview, quasi-legacy.
- My essays I think were my strongest part along with the letters of rec. I put a lot of time into brainstorming, writing
and editing. I did a good job I think of standing out without being gimmicky and showing emotional maturity. I'm proud
of my supplements, each of which was unique or odd in its own self-contained way.
Weaknesses: Extracurriculars and awards (nothing at nat'l level or field-related), SAT (avg for Stanford).
Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: I honestly think I had a lucky confluence of factors. I'd demonstrated interest (gone to HS visits, college fairs, toured campus, etc), had good recs, good essays, an SAT to get me into consideration, great GPA for course difficulty, a phenomenal interview, and a fortunate family connection to the university.
What would you have done differently?:Had more concentrated extracurriculars, maybe interned w. a newspaper or a political campaign/think tank. My ECs were the thinnest part (problem is I like to be well-rounded as a principle, not to be a resume stuffer).
Where else did you apply?
University of Utah (Honors College), USC. Was considering HYP, Dartmouth, Claremont Consortium and various LACs in Northeast, but at this point am likely going to commit to Stanford, so that'll probably be it.
Other Factors:
- Intended Major(s): Political Science, History, Int'l Relations
- More people apply to Stanford as STEM (all other applicants from my school did), which possibly means that
humanities and social studies admissions are less competitive in sense I'm against fewer people.
- Positive Outlook: In my essays and ECs I showed that I am above all else a (self-aware but not self-obsessed)
optimist. I think that may have struck a chord w. the admissions readers.
General Comments & Advice:
Be completely yourself. Don't try to fake it. Work hard at school, find something you love. And, if you don't find yourself completely into 1 thing/passion, be into being a generalist. That's what I did, and it seemed to work.
Also, start your app ASAP to fine tune it as much as possible. ",Stanford,2022

Essays (rating 1-10, details):
Common App- 5, almost feel like it was a hit or miss, they’d like it or find it immature, it was about my love of creating Halloween costumes when I was younger and how I’d combine different characters, and how it shows my creativity and that everything has multiple parts
Stanford:
Roommate- 8, I honestly loved all my Stanford specific ones, for roommate I linked each point I made and it really sounded like me
Learning- 7, I’m not sure how much depth was in this one or actually needed for this one, but I loved the topic, I did it on how I’m part Greek and how I love learning about that side of me and am trying to learn the language
Matters- 7.5, I actually changed this one last minute but I think it really depicts me and who I am, it was about my love of writing
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: 7, my 11th grade English teacher, I think good? I did well in that class, and he originally put me in AP Lang (which is before AP Lit) but said I could ask again after more essays; after I did, he said I could go to AP Lit, so if anything, he knows I’m motivated and such to take harder courses.
Teacher Rec #2: 8.5 I’m very wary of giving 9s or 10s, but I think this recommendation was really good, it was my 11th grade chemistry teacher; I didn’t do the best in his class (got a  but he gave me a chemistry award with some other students, and seemed enthusiastic when I asked him
Counselor Rec: 6.7 I’ve talked to her a lot over the past few years but I wouldn’t say she knows me personally; however, we had to fill out a sheet of questions with stuff they should/could mention, so it should be good
Interview: 9, it honestly went really well, she seemed very interested in my extracurriculars and called me a ""renaissance woman""

Essays (rating 1-10, details):
- Common App: 8/10. I wrote about how I use my childish enthusiasm to confront the challenges life throws at me. This essay was pretty weird. It included reflections on intolerance, Harry Potter references, and comments on life in Peru's capital.
- Stanford Supplements: 9/10. These were pretty original and the following topics were included: my addiction to coffee, the two sides of my personality (one side is named Frankie and the other Oliver, yeah I might be a psychopath), and why social inclusion is important to me.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: Junior and Senior year IB Environmental Systems and Societies teacher. I genuienly loved this teacher. This class was her first time teaching and she is one of the hardest working people I have ever met. She helped us all excel at the course. I became close to her while she advised me for a class research project. She actually showed me the letter and she said some really nice things (7/10).
Teacher Rec #2: Junior and Senior year IB Business Management teacher. He is literally more of a friend than a teacher. He cares so much about his students and strives to help them in their personal lives as well as in their academic lives. He also showed me the letter and it was absolutely amazing (9/10).
Counselor Rec: No one from my school has really ever applied to elite US colleges before, so I had to work alongside him. He tried his best every time we worked and researched the college application process together. He is also my ITGS teacher and my EE advisor, so I'm very close to him. I'm sure his letter is also amazing (8/10).
Additional Rec: Head of Senior School. She went with me to a conference in Brazil and we talked a lot about my future goals and my school life. She also oversaw my work in the Student Council and helped me jumpstart it. She showed me her letter and it was awesome! (8/10)

Reflection
Strengths: ACT score, essays, challenging course load, rank, GPA, ECs(?).
Weaknesses: Didn't submit Subject Tests. Asked for financial aid while being international.
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I feel like asking for FinAid is the reason for my deferral--they probably wanna evaluate all the applicants before budgeting FinAid for internationals. Also not submitting the subject tests might have been negative, although they are optional.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: No where yet!

I'm super glad with my decision and it has given me that motivational push to finish the rest of my apps. Stanford is a great school, and applying has let me reflect upon my life experience. I'm excited for late March and am hoping to get accepted somewhere, not necessarily Stanford  Best of luck to everyone currently in the application process, you're all amazing people that will accomplish great things. Congratulations to those who were accepted! And for those who were rejected, you will get into other fantastic schools! To those who were deferred, only time will tell.

Essays (rating 1-10, details):
Don't really know how to rank my essays to be completely honest. My common app essay was pretty good in my opinion, but could have fallen short in comparison to other applicants, and I don't really know what I'm comparing myself to. My short answers weren't the greatest, a bit rushed and may have lacked substance.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher #1: 9/10 Chemistry teacher, one of the few kids to get an A in his class. Remembered me to be a stand out student, may have been a bit short though.
Teacher #2: ?, Spanish teacher, had her for 3 years, honestly unsure how her letter was, but I know she really liked me as a student. Didn't really have other options in terms of recommenders because my 11th grade math teacher sucked and most of my other academic classes were duel enrollment, didn't form connections with those professors. \
Counselor: 8/10? Though I'm from a large public high school, I know my counselor well. Was my soccer coach in elementary years and have spoken to him way more than the average student. I can imagine he had great things to say about me.
Interview: Went extremely well, honestly considered declining because I don't tend to do well in public speaking/ interview settings. Conversation flowed well, connected with her on loss of immediate family member. She told me ""Stanford isn't looking for students with the 4.8 GPAs and 36 ACTs, but rather students with a story like yourself.""

General Comments:
I knew that applying to Stanford was an EXTREME reach, but I don't think I realized until now how little of a chance I had. Don't get me wrong lol, I knew I had an extremely slim chance but looking back I don't really think I had one at all. Even looking through this thread I see that I have the lowest scores and the least activities. My extracurriculars are extremely weak in comparison to even those who were also rejected. To be quite honest I didn't even realize HOW different these applicants were. In my mind it's almost as if they are a different breed. I'm not sure if I'm just oblivious, or if it's my school that never exposed me to the qualifications that these applicants hold. I'm not too upset though, of course it would have been a dream to get in, but I was definitely expecting rejection and I see now how many people deserve to go that didn't get in either, but I'm definitely glad I tried and will never have to wonder, ""What if?""

Job/Work Experience: nothing except helping my mom in her business but I didn't include this
Volunteer/Community service: Teen Advisory Board (TAB) Member since 4th grade at the local public library (we organize events for children and teens at the library and around the community), volunteered at Sacred Heart Senior Center a few times to play the violin for senior citizens.
Summer Activities: 2016: visited my family in China and attended Pennsylvania Free Enterprise Week (PFEW), a business program. 2017: LEDA!!!!!! (Leadership Enterprise for a Diverse America) at Princeton University, I'll explain this later
Essays (rating 1-10, details): tbh I think my essay were a strong part of my app BECAUSE of LEDA and my writing instructor there helping me through the whole process.
Personal Statement: 9/10 I made my personal statement very personal and close to my heart and I don't particularly think it's really unique, but I think it did convey what kind of person I was and what I valued.
Learning Essay: 6/10 honestly, this was probably my most problematic and just difficult essay because I don't know what major I want to study or what I want to be, and there wasn't many opportunities for me growing up. I think it was somewhat decent, but I could've written a much better essay.
Roommate Essay: 9/10 my personal favorite out of all that I've written. I didn't really focus on telling what I liked and stuff, and again I made it very personal in that it was like a handwritten letter telling my future roomie that I would love to meet her and how I love hugging and being affectionate.
Meaningful Essay: 8/10 my writing instructor's favorite I think. She said it was written very well and thoughtfully, and I had a great time writing it because I wrote about something that truly had a spot in my heart, even in another 20 years.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
I waived the right to read them so idk, but one teacher I had for 3 years and he also had my sister. However, I don't think he likes me as much as my sister lol because he absolutely loved her but oh well he probably likes me a decent amount. The other is a math teacher I had for two years for both Calcs and I think she likes me. I also like her class the most so that might say something. I don't have super strong relationships with really any of my teachers. I really love my counselor and she adores me so I think her recommendation was pretty good considering she has nothing but praise for me, I love her so much, and she had my sister for four years and me for these past four years too.
Interview: So, funny story, I missed my interview ****. But my counselor said it doesn't really count for much, so yeah it's fine, I mean at the time I was really about to kill myself

Reflection
Strengths: LEDA, tremendous help they gave me and I really think this and my essays were the highlights of my application. if you don't know what leda is, it's a 7 week residential program at Princeton for college prep in the summer before senior year. they help you throughout your senior year as well, and the 3 tier application process starts in junior year (btw this year's deadline is coming up, I believe it's the 12th of December)
Weaknesses: I mean I missed my interview, also I don't really have a passion for like the arts or engineering specifically. I have a broad range of interest and idk what I want to do or be. My recs might've been strong but I'm not really close with my teachers. Also, I don't have any like MAJOR awards, but then again I'm not sure if it hurt my app too much because like there are some really amazing people out there and not everyone can be a nationally ranked ballerina or something
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: bc LEDA and their help and because I'm pretty well rounded but I have a drive to be an important person in the future because I have a desire to be needed by the people around me.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: first college that gave me a decision, but I also applied to WashU, USC, and my state school Penn State
General Comments: I don't think of myself as special or privileged/underprivileged because I have a great family, but my whole life has been just about me making my own decisions, and I do well academically but then again my school isn't the greatest, in fact it's pretty bad academically. But I seek out other opportunities and have been building my profile and transcript/resume since like fourth grade. also I've wanted to go to Princeton since I first visited there in fourth or fifth grade and it was only summer that I found the courage to apply to Stanford because I was always fascinated by it but never though I'd have a chance. The people around me have a lot of confidence in me, but sometimes I don't have that same confidence in myself. So, I always think that you're not as great as you think you are, and your not as bad as you think you are. Even when you doubt yourself you still gotta try, and a rejection should just make you work more towards your goal. Don't let it bring you down. An acceptance should make you feel happy, but don't let it get to your head because there's always more to work for, and getting into college isn't everything, you gotta graduate and all that jazz.

Essays (rating 1-10, details):
Common App (10): about my struggle towards coming out as gay in rural KS, no need to specify more. extremely personal and shows slight humor
Vitality (8): talks about Qualitative Analysis Labs in Chemistry that everybody from past years said was extremely hard. talked about how it enhanced my knowledge of science and peaked my interest to continue studying this field.
Roommate (9): humorous, list of things, even talked about me piercing my friend's nipple which was a big risk but I felt would pay off in the end. if you truly write with a personal tone, I feel things will work out better for you. even though the university is highly pristine, they still like to see actual human qualities within a candidate and not just test scores
What matters (9.5): maintaining a sense of individualism and how critical this is in today's time. very well crafted and an intellectual masterpiece (okay maybe that's a little exaggerated but you get the point LOL)

Essays (rating 1-10, details):
Common App: 8 - I spent a lot of time on this. I knew that I wouldn't get in unless I really presented myself correctly. I wrote about my childhood love for Show-and-Tell and how it grew into a love for sharing my ideas, be it through art, speaking, or film (talked about ECs here). Basically my love letter to communication.
Intellectual Vitality: 8 - Talked about how the Christian church is a good example of effective communication. Like how church services use tools like speaking, art, film, and music to function. I explained that, outside of religious reasons, I go to church to learn effective, impactful communication.
Letter to Roommate: 10 - This essay is freaking beautiful. I basically ranted about how bad The Emoji Movie was and asked my roommate not to use emojis (since they traumatise me). It was a blast to write and all my friends thought it was funny.
What matters to me and why: 8 - Talked about my resting b*tch face and how it forces me to be very socially aware. Because of my RBF, I have to be conscious of how I look and talk to others. I tied it back into being a good communicator.
My essays have weird topics but they tied together, which I think is important.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: 7 - My AP English Language teacher. She liked me, so I'm guessing it was kind of ok, but I had basically no control over what she wrote.
Teacher Rec #2: 7 - My AP Econ teacher. He's a chill dude and probably wrote a decent letter. He started a few days before the deadline but I guess it turned out ok.
Counselor Rec: 6 - She barely knows me (I go to a big school). I told her some stuff about me but I doubt she put in the effort to make it above and beyond.
Additional Rec: 9 - My speech coach. I didn't get to see it but he knows me very well and cares about me. He probably spent a lot of time on this letter and wrote good things about me. He's a bro and I trust him 
Interview: 7 - Was clearly structured and systematic since he had to do like 6 interviews in one day (I saw people waiting to go after me). Kind of generic questions, but we had an interesting conversation about religion and Korean culture and stuff. I also explained why my freshman year grades were so bad, and I think he mentioned it to the admissions officers.

Reflection:
Strengths:
My test scores and being in a somewhat unpopular major probably helped. But I think my biggest strength was having a strong ""narrative."" I didn't really ""do"" much compared to others I know. I have like no leadership positions, work experience, or research, and I only did a few activities in high school. However, all those activities related to what I wanted to do in life, and I explained it all in my essays. Really, I think what got me in is how I painted a clear picture of myself. Humor probably helped too. Essays matter folks 
Weaknesses:
Being asian... also my grades and my ECs. My grades are prreeeetty bad (a few B's each year). Sure, they're not terrible, but they're a lot worse than other people who applied. I mean, a 3.6 getting into Stanford is pretty rare. Also, my ECs were somewhat lacking. I didn't start any clubs and I didn't have many leadership positions. I also didn't have many activities (probably only 3 that I care about). I didn't really accomplish anything big tbh, but I had a focus and I guess that was ok.
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected:
Like I said, I really pushed my identity is a communications person. And I didn't fake it either; I really care about the things I do and they all happen to relate to what I want to study in college. I think the officers saw that. Also, it probably helps that I'm not going into STEM (yuck).
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected:
Nowhere yet. I applied to USC for the scholarship deadline but results don't come back for a while. I kind of want to apply to some ivies but it's really hard to motivate myself after getting into my dream school lol.
General Comments:
Man, I am very surprised I got in. I never saw myself as a really strong student, and I feel like I didn't do enough in high school in terms of using my time for important activities. But I guess I did the things I love doing, and the admissions officers saw that through my essays. If you're like me and have pretty bad grades, don't give up! This really shows that your activities, essays, and drive are far more important. Also, plan all your essays together; think about how they connect and how an admissions officer reading the essays would see you. I guess just try to be yourself, but make sure that ""self"" is very clear.
Also... if you're reading a ton of these results threads late at night in your junior year after having a sudden panic attack about your college future, I was just like you! If you feel like you haven't done enough in high school and need to make up for it somehow, I feel you. I'm posting to help you fellow procrastinators and clutchers. If I could do it, so can you!
ALSO also, to all other CC posters, notice that I left large spaces between lines. It was pretty annoying reading through all of these results threads and getting lost in giant blocks of text so please grace the next year's class with convenient formatting

Essays (rating 1-10, details):
Common App - 9.5/10 I really loved this essay. I started it about three days before I submitted my application because that's really who I am. I used a parallel narrative structure to describe how I love to try everything and how I can't wait to explore as much as possible in college.
Roommate Essay - 9/10 I made this very uniquely me. I figured I should write about something genuine, so I wrote about my love of food and how I wanted my dorm room to always have food in it.
Intellectual Vitality - 8/10 I wrote about how I am inspired by history and how all of my history classes connected to produce a topic that I'm writing my honors thesis about. Hopefully it came off as very sincere.
Meaningful - 9/10 I wrote about a club I'm in at school that work to increase diversity throughout my school. I'm super duper passionate about it and I related it to what I want to do in the future and how I would continue working on reducing the opportunity gap throughout college.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): I didn't read this, but I'm gonna guess.
Teacher Rec #1: 10/10 - My AP Lang teacher wrote this one. I did really well in his class, but I also am very close to him. He knows my personality so well, and you can find me hanging out in his classroom at least once a week even though he doesn't teach me anymore. He knows how sarcastic I am, but also how much I push myself. He's also a fantastic writer.
Teacher Rec #2: 9/10 AP Calc BC teacher/Pre-Calc teacher. I've had her for two years. She knows me relatively well, but she's also seen my passion for math and knows how much I love the subject. Even if I don't do my homework on occasion, she's definitely seen how much I participate and how excited I am about math. She also wrote my letter of rec for SAMS, and it was really wonderful!
Counselor Rec: 9/10 I love my counselor so much and she loves me! She knows me really well for a counselor and she's always been here to help me, even though I think I only introduced myself to her halfway through junior year, which I was told was a terrible idea. She said it was so easy to hit send on my letter and I bet it was really good! She's so awesome!
Additional Rec: N/A. I really panicked because I looked through the posts on last year's thread after I applied, and it seemed like everyone had an additional letter. It was too late to ask my boss, so I definitely thought that I made a major mistake.
Interview: 10/10 I probably seemed a little nervous, but I was able to answer all of her questions naturally and comfortably. We talked for about an hour and a half, digressing from Stanford chat to conversations about high school and human nature and diversity. It was such a great opportunity to talk with an alum and we had some really special conversations. I feel like I was able to elaborate a little more on who I am as well, which made me feel a lot better. I walked out of it beaming.

Reflection
Strengths: My essays (unique and honest), letters of rec, theme of application (desire to try new things)
Weaknesses: only one SAT II, class rank not exceptional, no saving the world or starting a company, not a ton of major awards
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I think my essays really showed that I'm a fit for the school. I think my passion for learning and trying things made me unique, because my stats really aren't fantastic.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Nowhere. I only applied Stanford early as it was my top choice, so now I'm done applying!
General Comments:
My mom always says ""you'll end up where you belong."" Always try, and you'll end up where you're supposed to be! Also, you don't have to have saved the world or write about deep, profound things to be honest and unique! Good luck to future applicants, congrats to future Trees, and to everyone who didn't get in, I know you'll be so successful and fit well wherever you go to school! ",Stanford,2022

Reflection
Strengths:
Being a good speaker (interview ayyy), my essays weren't boring, and my ECs were definitely well rounded. Stanford apparently also really likes IB students and I think that really helped me. My research definitely helped me get my name out there as well due to my published paper.
Weaknesses:
Low grades, being Asian. Not a ton of major awards. I didn't really accomplish anything that really stood out but it was enough to get noticed.
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected:
Being an athlete, researcher, AND artist really helped ""advertise"" the fact that I was well-rounded. I really emphasized that in my essay and I guess it was enough? My main EC (research) really helped give me a leg up in my intended major.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected:
Just a few within Canada. I only applied to Stanford in the US.
General Comments:
Always expect the unexpected. I actually applied to Stanford for fun because I wanted to make a meme out of the rejection letter. Your essay is the most important part of your application, in my opinion. It really shows who you are and helps admissions officers decide if you fit Stanford's standards (ooh alliteration). Best of luck to future applicants! ",Stanford,2022

Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): (never got to read any of these)
Teacher Rec #1: (9/10) ap english teacher - absolutely loved having me in his class, would talk to other students and teachers about how talented he thought I was, genuinely one of my favorite people, so probably a pretty good rec letter
Teacher Rec #2: (8/10) honors alg 2 teacher - I did extremely well in this class and the teacher always sent students who needed help to me, she's known for writing really good letters
Counselor Rec: (9/10) I'm really close with my college counselor and she was a major source of support for me while I was going through the whole tornado thing, so she got to know me really well and said she even mentioned how well I dealt with loss and my resilience throughout the situation

Essays (rating 1-10, details):
Common App: 6. I don't like it very much honestly, though that might be because I'm tired of looking at it. It's about how I have a tradition of learning something new and random every summer (juggling, guitar, coding, etc).
Roommate: 9. I thought this one was awesome! It definitely showed why Stanford was right for me.
Intellectual Vitality: 9. Okay I thought it was good, but it was unconventional so I bet the adcoms didn't like it. It was about how I look at everything from an evolutionary perspective and how art fascinates me because it deviates from biological necessity. Weird, I know.
What Matters: 8. Looking back it might have been too sappy. It was about how my dad (who died about a year ago) used to take me up this one mountain.

Reflection
Strengths: GPA, test scores, geographic location
Weaknesses: white Jew, CA essay, lackluster recs?
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I have a really specific reason for why I think I was rejected. My school has a reputation with colleges, so acceptances are kind of a niche--there's always one or two people from my school that get accepted to Stanford. Two other kids got accepted from my school this year, and I am basically a blend of them (one has the exact same GPA/academic strengths/major and career plans, one has all the same extracurriculars). If I was the only semi-talented person applying from my school, I might have been accepted, but unfortunately Stanford filled their niche and I'm the one who got the short end of the stick.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: haven't gotten other decisions back yet
General Comments: I had never wanted anything as bad as I wanted to get into Stanford. Getting rejected hurt, especially because everyone around me constantly bombarded me with things like, ""What do you mean you're worried about college? You'll get accepted anywhere you want to go."" Don't listen to people that don't understand that college admissions is a crapshoot!!! And don't let yourself get too attached to a school. I started to envision myself at Stanford and ended up getting my heart broken. Also, highlight adversity! I should have emphasized my economic situation way more (single-parent household, mom got laid off this year, I work 2 jobs). I shied away from the parental-cancer-death and work-to-help-my-family clichés and I actually regret it big time. ",Stanford,2022

- common app (7) - most ppl who have read it have liked it, but i dont rlly like it bc i super rushed it and i feel like it was rlly cliche/melodramatic. i have fixed it now but since my deadline to apply to stanny was october 15th (bc art portfolio) it was super rushed. i talked abt asking questions my entire life and always wanting to search for answers even tho i may never find them loool.. also mentioned being from mexico very briefly
- intellectual vitality (6) - UGH i hated this one. i talked abt art and the fact that im interested in many types of art, even the ones i havent explored yet... the reason i dont like it is bc i felt redundant bc i talk abt art in all my supps lmao and also i wish i wouldve talked abt psychology instead
- roommate essay (9.5) - i actually rlly liked this one... my name is andy so i compared myself to famous people named andy
- what matters to u and why (9) - it was rlly weird... i talked abt doodling things on my skin with pen and being scolded in elementary school bc of this lol.. but i guess the weirdness is good

Essays did not show personality or passion. Essay topics not chosen particularly well -- did not share them or get input. Not very many summer activities.
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected:
Discovered regional admissions director for my state was hired in November -- so not much experience for making a decision on early applicants the first week of December, and my school is tiny and has not had many students admitted to top schools. I think my what matters to me essay rubbed someone the wrong way.

General Comments:
While legacy and test scores and GPA are wonderful things, you really need to craft your essays to sell yourself, you need to show a passion and not just go for well-rounded. I was excited about applying early, but think applying regular decision and spending a little more time spent on my application, as well as having an opportunity to add more activities and meat to my application would have been a better choice.

I struggled more in calculus BC (I didn't take AB, which might've contributed to that), and I was always in her class after school for help. She knows I'm driven and want to succeed.
Counselor Rec: 7 - LOL, I go to public school. She literally recieved the request for a rec then called me into her office so she could learn about me.
Additional Rec: 9 - The owner of the restaurant I work at/my boss - She talked about how she trusts me to run her restaurant on my own, how well I am under pressure, and my coolness when talking to upset customers.

Getting into the places I did was an extreme shock for me and I couldn't have imagined it in a million years. Though I have a tough decision to make, I'm extremely grateful for it. If you are unsure if you should apply, just go for it. If Stanford's your dream school and you get rejected, don't feel bad. You will succeed anywhere that you may go. In my case getting rejected from my dream school just led me to greater options.

Decision: Accepted
General Comments: Stats of admitted students can't tell you anything other than that stats aren't everything (i must repeat: STATS AREN'T EVERYTHING). It's up to the admissions officers and what they want is anyone's guess so stressing about scores is absolutely the wrong thing to do. Just show yourself through your essays and do your best, but know that whatever happens it's up to you to make the best of the situation.

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Everyone who gets accepted to Stanford is extraordinary in some way. I think although my grades and scores weren't phenomenal they were good enough to demonstrate that I was a competent student that could survive at Stanford. So I'd say that I probably didn't have quite as spectacular achievements of most of the admits.

Essays (rating 1-10, details):
Common App Essay: 9
I wrote about my experience at NOAA, using the childhood to adulthood prompt. I talked about learning how to program independently and finding my love for the scientific method. I also made sure to emphasize my love for the process of learning, for knowledge itself. A bit cliche, but I think it did the job.
Stanford Activity Essay: 9
I wrote about my love for the peace and quiet of swimming. I think it stood out because it demonstrated that I don't only participate in academic activities, that I also love the teamwork and community of my sport.
Stanford Intellectual Vitality Essay: 7
I talked about the need to listen to different viewpoints, but I think it could have been misinterpreted after the election. 
Stanford Roommate Essay: 7
I thought this essay was slightly generic; I just wrote about my various quirks and that I hoped we could accept each other.
Stanford ""What Matters to You?"": 9
I thought this essay was really good, as it explored my love for nature and my hope to make a difference in our changing climate.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: 10- This was from my history teacher, and it was really good. I was the only student to receive a 7 on the IB test at my school, so he really made it count.
Teacher Rec #2: 7- This was from my physics teacher, and it was slightly generic but still decent.
Counselor Rec: 5- My school is giant, so the counselors don't really know the students...
Additional Rec: 10- I was deferred to regular decision, so I got my chemistry teacher to write me an additional rec letter. I was his student aide, and we have a really good relationship, so I'm assuming that this really helped.
Interview: 10- My interviewer asked me a lot about the research that I have done at NOAA, and we ended up talking for over an hour.

Reflection
Strengths: I thought my essays were really good, as writing has always been one of my strengths. I think that they really conveyed my work ethic and my love for learning. In addition, my test scores are also pretty good. I also think that I presented a clear narrative through my activities-the environment, research about the environment at NOAA, yet that I also presented balance through my love for swimming. I also think that my rec letters were really good.
Weaknesses: I haven't taken as many AP tests as a lot of people because of the IB Program. I also haven't done many academic competitions or held many leadership positions.
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I think that it probably came down to my essays, which I worked really hard on. I really felt that they represented who I am. I also emphasized the fact that I taught myself how to program and my initiative through my research at NOAA, which I think that they probably appreciated. I tried to present a coherent picture and to connect the dots in my application.

Rejected: Harvard, Princeton, Pomona
General Comments:
Honestly, I think that this process is just a lottery. I'm still so shocked that I got in because I know that there are so many people who are more qualified that I am. College is what you make of it, so even if you didn't get in, there will still be so many opportunities. I am just so grateful for the one that has been given to me.

Reflection: I really beat myself up about the college application process. I feel like all I did for a year was read posts on college confidential, obsess about the 3's I had on AP's, the average class rank I had, and whether or not I was winning enough debate tournaments or entering enough writing/art contests. And I definitely had this whole misconception about how being asian meant I wouldn't get in anywhere. Getting deferred from Yale early crushed me, but it was good because I snapped back to reality and started focusing on doing the things I love again. In the end, it didn't even matter, and I got in regular decision after sending almost no updates to my original application. I'm still amazed that I get to go to my dream school, and it's a great feeling, but in the end, the whole process amounted to this one letter. And all I can say from the other side is that it's not worth beating yourself up for, because it will never define you. I always thought people who said 'you'll end up where you belong' where ridiculous optimists, but from the other side I can see that it's true. Colleges accept you based on how you'll fit on their campus, so an acceptance or denial is never a judge of worth, but rather a judge of applicability, and everything happens for the best. I'm just making this post because 1. I hope it reminds some people that you can get into an ivy or top ten school even if you're an asian with imperfect stats 2. these posts were a guide for me 3. if you're genuinely passionate about something, let it shine through
Strengths: Debate accomplishments, passion for feminism
Weaknesses: Rank, SAT II, and AP scores
Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: I think I was accepted because it was clear that I only did things I was really deeply passionate about

@yalegirl681 Your stats are very near perfect, way better than my kid's. In the same intended major also. Why did you apply Yale early when Stanford was your number one choice? Getting 770 in SAT II and one or two 3s in AP is not bad at all. IMO your getting into Stanford and Yale is not at all surprising. ",Stanford,2021

^ Agree with above. Was also an AB Duke scholar, which is even more selective. 6/400 hardly qualifies as ""average class rank"". ",Stanford,2021

@renaissancedad All I gotta say is that if the above stats are ""not nearly perfect"", my kid's stats are not worthy of even applying to HYPSM.  My kid was very happy when he got around 750 in the same SAT subject tests. He has mostly 4 and 3s, except 5 on English language AP tests. ",Stanford,2021

Strengths: I think it was my essays, for sure. At every other college, I tried super hard to be formal and deep and meaningful, but I just let loose with my Stanford essays. They were bold and risky, but were the best reflection of my true self.
Weaknesses: Test scores, haven't rid the world of cancer yet
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: It's probably the essays, again. They don't accept many kids from my area to the school, and they hadn't in six years... so that helped. I think I just presented myself in a very truthful way and that resonated well with my reader.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Accepted at Duke, Swarthmore, WashU, Middlebury, Emory, and U of I. Waitlisted at Harvard, Penn, Brown, Cornell, Columbia, Amherst, Williams, Georgetown, Tufts. Rejected at Princeton, Yale, and Dartmouth.
General Comments: Look, I'm shocked I got in. After a metric buttload of waitlists the day before, I was sure Stanford was out. But, I think if you apply to Stanford with a certain mindset and approach the application with your best intentions in mind, it'll pull through. Stanford was not my dream school because I never though I'd get in.. but here we are  Good luck to any future applicants!! ",Stanford,2021

General Comments:
Stanford was my reach & dream school; I've wanted to go here ever since 7th Grade. I knew how difficult it would be to get acceptance, but I still put my best foot forward and put together an application that I am so proud of.
My advice to future applicants? Don't be afraid to apply. It takes guts to even submit an application to schools like this; regardless of the result, be proud of yourself and what you've done. You'll do great things no matter where you end up. ",Stanford,2021

Essays (rating 1-10, details): Common App essay was a 10, very personal wrote about how seemingly small events in my childhood helped shape my world view, talked a lot about where I came from. The short essays were fun to write! I talked about little odd things about me in the note to my roommate but stayed as genuine as I could without sounding like I was trying too hard to sound unique. Talked about learning how to appreciate my education more as a learning experience rather than a pursuit of good grades through a little summer activity I did with a friend. In the what matters to me essay, I made an analogy to a road trip I took through California over the summer.

Was sort of expecting this the whole time. Not really a surprise since Stanford is so selective. I would've been happy to get accepted but I do have some great safety and match schools in mind anyway.
Strengths:
Test scores, grades, recommendations, ISSYP, Reach for the Top National finals, Contest performance, URM maybe?
Weaknesses:
Lack of demonstrated leadership, narrowly focused extracurriculars, international applicant asking for a lot of financial aid. Also essays and interview were probably too lackluster.

Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected:
General Comments:
I am still applying to other school such as Caltech and MIT (duh from my username) as well as safeties and matches in Canada, and I won't let this rejection drag me down. This rejection is just further proof of how selective these elite schools are becoming, rather than a reflection of who I am as a person/student. I wish that I were at least deferred but alas, such is life. I also would like to thank everyone on CC past and present for helping me through this application process. I am mostly a lurker and rarely sign in but I have read so many posts on here. Thank you for everything and congratulations to all those who are accepted! ",Stanford,2021

Summer Activities: Internships, Pre Vet Med Program, Mostly just painted, Cheerleading/Track practice, and studying.
Essays (rating 1-10, details): Common App Essay, 7, I’m a decent writer and I wrote (what I thought was interesting) story about rescuing a grasshopper on a train. I tied the idea back to living in Jakarta, Indonesia, and my escapades with my father’s friend in the forest (he collects insects). I concluded with how it’s affected my philosophical views and inspired my interest in Buddhism.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): 7.5 Be honest. Nothing matters if you are not honest. Be genuine, and try to use these essays as a way to find out who you are. If you have a hard time writing the essays it might just be that the school doesn’t suite your lifestyle or wishes.
Teacher Rec #1: AP Lit and AP Lang Teacher, we’re very close and exchange books and movies. We’re like the stereotypical english teacher and student who stay in during lunch and talk about “Who’s afraid of Virginia Woolf and watch Saturday night live skits”
Teacher Rec #2: AP Chem Teacher, probably thought I was weird because of my ocd tendencies and meticulousness in science. I came from a chemistry regulars class and ended up doing a lot better than the previously honors students. Hoping he writes about overcoming adversity but who knows how far they stray from generic.
Counselor Rec: Didn’t see it.
Interview: It went well I think. He wouldn’t let me get past the idea that I’ve moved around like a billion times so it kind of made me seem a little pretentious about my travels but I guess it’s good he wouldn’t stop asking questions. He asked to see my art though and was (thankfully) very impressed. When asked why veterinary medicine, I may have accidently said it was because dogs were altruistic (which sounds dumb, but I get a bit childish when talking about my passions).

—Teacher Rec #2—Chem Teacher (8/10): Same as USH but a little less fire the first time, a little more bland. She is also a good friend and gave me resources and tutoring for USNCO.
—Counselor Rec (9/10): Our school has a low counselor to student ratio so these are gonna be guaranteed gucci. She made sure to include some sentiments from our head of school (AKA the big man who rules over all principals of high school, middle school, and elementary school).
—Additional Rec—PA from summer lab (9/10): She made time to write a letter for me, simple enough. We bonded over discussions about Maryland's obsession with Old Bay, competition soccer in Utah, and of course stem cells.
—Interview (13,000/10): The chillest thing I've ever done, even considering that I'm a long winded talker AND know how to be a kiss-a**. Still one of the most interesting talks I've had with an adult, even though her line of work was completely different from my dreams. It wasn't scripted at all, just a wonderful talk about family, friends, and my sleep schedule over some killer green tea.

General Comments:
All lightheartedness aside, here's a little beef I have with College Confidential in general: they take s••• like they have to cure cancer and rack up Olympiad medals to be even in the sniffing area of schools like these. I did Chem Olympiad simply because I love chemistry and it was accessible to me, not because of admissions. That's how I wanted to distinguish myself: appearing actually interested in the things I did and passionate about them too! If you love research like me, don't rush to complete a project just for admissions; heck, one of my ideas will be going into clinical trials for years after I graduate high school! DO WHAT YOU LOVE, DO IT WELL, DO IT WHOLEHEARTEDLY FOR YOU, AND MAKE SURE YOU'RE PASSIONATE.
Secondly, I don't understand how all y'all can apply to more than 11 schools, I'm already burned out through 5 schools, and I got 6 more to go.
Thirdly, good luck to y'all, I honestly still don't know how I got in. But The Man Above sometimes has got different ideas. To those who didn't get in, life goes on, I'm still expecting my fair share of rejection and tears. But to all, keep cool and stay in school, chiefs!!!! ",Stanford,2021

Essays (rating 1-10, details): Although very subjective I will try my best to give my opinion of them.. I will say that I spent many, many hours on my essays but I must admit I am no great writer. I've been primed throughout high school to write science labs and research papers and it seemed that I had lost my touch with creative writing. Luckily I revised A LOT and found my voice, though I wish I could have been more eloquent with my essays. Perhaps my lack of reading throughout high school has allowed me to become rusty with my writing skills lol.
Commonapp: (7-9/10) I tried really hard on this, but it still came out sounding a bit too elevated and lofty. Theme was very sincere and unique. Talked about my research project on cancer cells and how I was too ambitious and ended up behaving like cancer's unending growth.
Intellectual Vitality: (8/10) Wrote about how I was interested in microbio research, specifically the potential and risks of CRISPR, and how I cared about curing my mom's diabetes, as well as pushing past fears of risky new science (directly tried to appeal to Stanford's risk-taking environment, but it did not sound artificial)
Letter to Roommate: (7-8/10) Wrote a series of personal facts about myself scattered around the room through post-it notes (tried to be creative and witty), but I realized in retrospect one of my personal facts was quite generic (wrote about dreaming ways to solve the world's most daunting problems, kinda cringy)
What Matters To You: (8/10) Wrote about a pregnant teen I met in El Salvador and how I realized that Model UN was interesting and stimulating, but was really not doing anything concrete or helping anyone. Talked about how this girl made me realize how important education and opportunity are, yet so rare in the world.
Extracurricular Essay: (9-10/10) Wrote about how I witnessed a surgeon I was shadowing drive screws into a patients arm during surgery and how it really excited me. Talked about how I gained lots of new perspectives from all of my experiences at the governor's school and how my time there fostered collaboration. (This one was my favorite. It was definitely the wittiest and most interesting.) I will reproduce it below so you guys can get a taste of my writing lol:
""Turns out, power tools are allowed in the OR. I learned this fact rather graphically, as I watched the orthopedic surgeon I was shadowing use an electric screwdriver to drive five screws into an unconscious patient’s forearm.
My time at the Governor’s School for Medicine was filled with immersive and exciting moments. I was captivated by the diverse group of guest speakers, ranging from geneticists to epidemiologists, who showed me healthcare’s multiple facets. I attended conferences with oncologists, PhD researchers, and radiologists, all of whom converged to engage in heated discussions over unclear breast cancer diagnoses. I worked with my peers to solve obscure and dire case studies, forcing us to think as doctors would in the face of treating a dying patient; we each contributed a unique perspective in solving these puzzles.
Using power tools is cool; collaborating with these brilliant minds was even cooler.""
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):

Income Bracket: 150k
Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): research project maybe, but how many asians do scientific research? besides, I had no awards to show for
Reflection
Strengths: Dedication to research project (although it did not pan out), humanitarian interest/passion with MUN and Debate, grades, SAT II, essays were pretty good Imo
Weaknesses: well... actually debate and MUN are very generic activities too, but I loved every second of it, and I have no regrets doing them in my high school career; SAT was passable but really subpar,
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I was really too generic of an applicant, and my essays albeit pretty good, were never spectacular. I was in, arguably, the hardest pool to get selected from, as I was an asian male applying from a city/suburb area. (I also live about 45 minutes from TJ, so a ton of qualified people probably applied from there as well)
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: nowhere, but fairly confident I can make UVA as I applied early and in-state
General Comments: Ahhhh my heart thudded really really hard as I checked my decision. I knew the odds were not in my favor, but hope persisted even when I tried to silence it. I would be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed, but this is a really good learning lesson. I don't hate Stanford, and I know very well that there are many people who worked a lot harder than me. Ironically, I take comfort in the fact that I was rejected fair and square; I'm sure there are plenty of people who deserve Stanford more than I do. Personally, I regret the time I wasted goofing off and procrastinating throughout high school, not doing something productive and really polishing my application from the start.
To those who got in congratulations! ",Stanford,2021

Reflection If you have the opportunity to do an arts supplement, do it. It is a way for admissions to see another side of you. And, the drama dept said that they would fight for you if they were impressed. Can't hurt having people on the inside fighting for you. Don't waste time in school joining dinky little clubs...create your own areas to be a leader.

Counselor Rec: There are two college counselors for my school and a class of 700+ seniors. I'm sure she put effort into making them as personal as possible, but I had only three 1 hour long meetings with her, all of them this year, before she wrote the letter for me.

Never hurts to apply I guess. Everyone said I was a shoo-in but I knew I wasn't. Only person who didn't tell me I'd get in for sure was my college counselor, she said I was likely to get deferred and she was right haha. Twin sis also got deferred.

honestly not sure; didn't read any of them
Teacher Rec #1: maybe an 8.5???? my stat teacher, which is what I want to do; was definitely the best (most successful anyway) student in any of his classes last year; he wrote a pretty beautiful email to my parents at the end of the year about me and my work ethic and my influence on other students in the class etc., so I would hope that his rec would've taken on a similar tone. He also graduated from Harvard if that has any type of effect
Teacher Rec #2: probably an 8; not sure. my gov teacher, definitely one of my favorite teachers ever and he knows it; young guy, super fun, and a great teacher to boot. He really liked me and I did really well in his class. I'd like to think that he understands me/my sense of humor but it was sometimes hard to tell haha. I'm pretty sarcastic and he's funny but not in that way. Anyway, cool teacher, would never write anything bad about ANYONE and definitely had plenty of nice things to say. Above average for sure but can't say how far
Counselor Rec: maybe a 7, 7.5; never really had a relationship with her in any type of way but she's super nice and on top of things. We got along for sure but there was never any real conversation we had. Still, I'm one of the top students in my grade, which is one of the most competitive ever within an already-competitive school, so I'm sure she wrote about how hard my course load has been and whatnot

General Comments:
I know these threads can be super discouraging at times, and falling in love with Stanford can seem like the absolute worst type of karma. But it's all gonna be alright in the end for every last one of you, however platitudinous that may sound. At the end of September I had to make a decision between applying early decision to Penn, where I (~80%) would've gotten in (legacy), and Stanford, where I, like everyone else, had little to no chance of being admitted. It seemed like a tough decision at the time but I have honestly not had a single regret about the choice I made, even if it means I don't end up getting into a top school.

General Comments: It took a lot of effort to become a valid candidate for Stanford and I’m extremely happy with the results. I’ve tried nearly everything to find my passion, make a difference, and help my community during my time in high school. I’ve experience multiple instances of failure (not elected student body president, failed to qualify for the semifinalist round the USABO after making a testing center for our school, not elected state student council president, failed to become good at the sports I’ve been in, etc) but haven’t let those things define me. I didn’t think I would get into Stanford since I didn’t really have anything “magical” about my application, but in the end coming off as a genuine, charismatic person from North Dakota seemed to make all the difference.

Essays (rating 1-10, details): I spent a lot of time on them. I got opinions on how to improve them from a lot of different teachers and friends.
Common App: 9.5 - I really like it. It took me forever to actually get started but I thought of the perfect sentence in the shower one day and built the whole thing around that, lol.
What Matters Most: 9 - This one took me the shortest amount of time to complete. I wrote it about improving the state of public education in the US and how my experiences in a public school have helped me form an opinion.
Future Roommate: Like, 7.5? - I kind of struggled with this one, and thought it was a little weird (which could be either a good or a bad thing) but I was happy with it in the end. My teacher called it “cute.”
Intellectual Vitality (still not entirely sure what that means): 8 - Talked about breaking down old subjects when I tutor. I actually changed my topic really late, I had something about my bedroom and discovery what entropy is, but I decided to scrap it.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): Didn’t read any of them:
Teacher Rec #1: 9 - One of my favorite teachers ever. I’ve had him 3 times now (for Bio, Anatomy & Physiology, and Mol Cell Bio), and he’s been challenging and pushing me since day 1. He gave me my first F, and I thank him for it, haha!
Teacher Rec #2: 8 - Have him for the second time for math (had him for calc I & III). Great teacher, and kind of a legend at our school. He’s always told me he expects great things from me and has always been there for me, so I assume it was pretty good.
Counselor Rec: I don’t actually know my counselor that well. She’s kind, helps me out often, and told me she really believes in me so I guess like 7??
Additional Rec: 9 - Previous teacher who loved me, so it was probably really good. Because it was another teacher, my counselor called and had this one faxed over.
Interview: I really enjoyed it. I felt prepared (I practiced a few times with Teacher #2) so I wasn’t too nervous.The man was really nice and it didn’t feel awkward or anything. It was pretty short though, only like 30 minutes. I did send him a thank you note later.

Reflection
Strengths: I really took my time with the essays and revised them over and over and over. My uncle (dad’s brother) went to Stanford, maybe that helped a little? One of my good friends in the Class of 2020 really guided me through the process and helped me to not freak out at every turn. I had a really good support system through the whole thing and I’m really grateful for that.
Weaknesses: I wish I had started everything earlier. I never really felt like I had any “hooks.” Honestly, when people told me they thought I’d be accepted, I didn’t really believe them.
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: My grades and scores are good, and all my ECs are long term things that I’ve put a lot of time into. I think my essays were really strong. Like I said before, I took my time, and wrote about things that were a little unexpected (my entire Common App Essay was about baking).
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I’ve only applied to two other schools so far, and haven't heard anything back. Stanford has been my #1 for years!
General Comments: Really nothing else to say. Congratulations to all of you who were accepted. To everyone else, you are going to become who you were meant to be regardless of where you go. You’re all extraordinary students who will blossom elsewhere. Good luck to everyone! ",Stanford,2021

Essays (rating 1-10, details):
Common App: 9.5/10 Very personal and interwove lots of details from my life pretty coherently, and creative topic choice that everyone knows but probably few have written about. Showed to a couple people I didn't know who said it was among the best they've seen. Worked on it for around a month over the summer, probably the best I'm capable of writing. Should have done this for all my essays!
Intellectual Vitality: 7/10 Opened with a story about Santa Claus and somehow tied it in. I think a little juvenile but I'll bump it a couple points for creativity.
Roommate: 6/10 Personal and funny but not particularly well organized. I feel like most of these are good so I'll say mine is pretty much in the same ballpark as most others.
What Matters to You: 9/10 Taking family walks around my neighborhood every night. Talks about importance of family, which is a little cliche but I've lost a parent and have a brother with special needs, so very authentic. By far my best supplement IMO.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: 9/10 from my biology teacher. I believe the same letter was a big factor in winning a major award so I will rate it pretty well. Really likes me and it showed in letter.
Teacher Rec #2:8-10/10 from my math teacher. She's been teaching at my school for 30+ years, so if she put stuff about best in career could have been outstanding. Didn't see it so I'll give a range
Counselor Rec: 8.5/10 Public school counselor, but I know her outside of school because she has a sister in Special Olympics, so probably more personal than the typical letter.

Strengths: (sorry I can't elaborate more; don't want too much personal/identifiable info out on CC) but ECs were very focused and had direction as in matched with my intended majors/areas of interest
Weaknesses: Test scores werent that great tbh
Why you think you were accepted: my ECs were very unique and specialized, researched a ton about stan and the atmosphere and culture and showed that i was compatible with school through essays, essays revealed ""human"" side and were deeply personal and showed that i wasn't a robot but a human with a lot of internal struggles, emotions, etc
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: University of Nevada Las Vegas
General Comments:
Okay. So. Basically I discovered CC when I was just starting sophomore year and this website is amazing for becoming informed about opportunities, programs and just how to approach college admissions but it's also pretty terrible for self-esteem, feeling useless, etc. So please take what you need from CC but don't listen to the rude, stuck-up people (there are a lot of them here, sadly) and PLEASE if you do one thing when applying for stan or any other college, WORK ON YOUR ESSAYS A LOT and make them genuine and showcase your fun, crazy, quirky personality and habits and what not and make them very personal 
Don't listen to anyone who says ""no you can't"" or ""you're not good enough"" on this thread and apply wherever you want to and work really hard on making your app focused, ""spiked"" and essays that are personal, genuine and showcase your spunky side -- don't be afraid to be bold in them!
Also, as an Asian male with not great scores, I can tell you that what got me in isn't anything academic related (although my scores and gpa and course rigor definitely let me ""pass the first hurdle"" into admissions) but moreso a strong focus and bold, quirky essays essays ESSAYS ESSAYS i can't stress this enough! 
Good luck to all prospective applicants and believe it or not I was in your position since 3 FREAKING YEARS AGO, running through threads and being amazed at such qualified, interesting people while also feeling dumb/unmotivated, so I know it's tough. I know sometimes you just wanna give up. But please keep going. Not even for college, but for life because this crazy, nerve-wracking process that is college admissions will help you become a stronger individual who is better prepared to tackle bigger challenges in the future.

Essays (rating 1-10, details):
Common app 8 - I thought I had a good concept and message, but I was trying out a parallel narrative, and while some really liked the effect, others thought it was confusing (one person even said ""it makes me doubt your ability as a writer"" lol) so who knows
roommate 6 - Pretty generic. I started and ended on the same note though, so the tying together at the end probably made it seem more than pretty generic.
intellectual vitality 7 - i talked about my love for langauges and such, and I think what may have helped was that it wasn't the general ""I went to a program"" or ""I did research"" or ""I learned about"" but more ""I noticed this in the wonderful world around meh""
what matters 7 - I wrote about human rights issues in China and how it affected the people I love, and what I want to do about it. good intentions, but a pretty averagely written essay
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: 9 Japanese teacher, I worked really hard in his class and was probably the only person who did, so I stood out. We had a great relationship and I think his rec letter played a huge part in my acceptance.
Teacher Rec #2: 7 11 AP English teacher. I got along pretty swell with her, and her rec letters are (I hear) pretty good, so probably good but nothing special.
Counselor Rec: 5 doesn't know me well
Additional Rec: 6 supervisor from summer internship. I read it and it was complimentary, but pretty one-sided.
Interview: It went great! I think it had to do with the fact that she was just as introverted and awkward as I was, so I didn't feel as threatened and thus didn't do as bad as I normally would have. It was really short though. Like 35 minutes short.
Other: I submitted an art portfolio! I think it's somewhere between average and great, definitely not anything to gape at. But I think it helped, or at least I hope it did.

Strengths: Experiences were unique, collective effect of rec letters should have been pretty great, interview went swell also
Weaknesses: weak EC's & GPA
Why you think you were accepted: I dunno man. I really didn't expect this to happen; I kept on comparing myself to other people, especially on the CC discussion forum. I think it has mostly to do with what I mentioned under ""strengths.""
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: As of now, just Michigan State and Purdue lol. Waiting on University of Michigan, Columbia, Princeton, MIT, and Yale.
General Comments: I think Stanford heavily emphasizes kindness and candidness of character. I showed a bit of that through a few of my essays as well as in my interview, and from what I observe of the other student in my school who got in REA, the same applies. I'm not saying fake it, because people say adcoms would be able to tell and I would like to believe that, but it's something to keep in mind.
I think another thing to think about when compiling your application is your personal story. The majority of your application (essays, recs, ec's) should reflect this story and follow it. My story was kind of a ""I love STEM, but WAIT, I also love art and linguistics, so I'd love to do a combination of that stuff!"" type of thing. It wasn't really well thought-out, actually, but I guess it worked kinda. ",Stanford,2021

Essays (rating 1-10, details):
Common App - 10/10. This essay is why I think I got into Stanford. I wrote about how my family was in the Unificationist Church, which believes Reverend Sun Myung Moon is the messiah/ second coming of Christ. I described how this affected my relationship with my parents, community, and academics. My upbringing in this church also inspired my career goal - to become an education policymaker and make education more equitable for all races, socioeconomic classes, and genders. My last two lines were - While we cannot control where we are born, we can determine our own destiny. I proudly sing along with Nina Rosario from the musical In the Heights: ""I am the one who made it out.""
Extracurricular Essay - 8/10. I wrote about Interact Club and how it helped me feel valuable at my school. I was very much an outsider my freshman/sophomore year (which explains the lack of ECs). However, through service, I found a community and learned that despite my limited resources I could still positively impact my community.
Short Questions - 8/10. I tried to be funny, quirky, and light-hearted in these responses. I felt that this helped to balance my application. Also, I actually made a typo - I wrote ""FiftyThirtyEight"" instead of ""FiveThirtyEight"". This goes to show you don't have to be perfect.
Intellectual Vitality - 9/10. I wrote about my experience at Kumon. Many students didn't understand why they were learning phonics, specifically diphthongs. I explained that both basic and complex aspects of a subject are crucial to our understanding. Without phonics, we don't have language. Also, I tied in a prime-generating polynomial as an example of something that's both complex and basic. It was a stretch, to say the least.
Note to future roommate - 7/10. Very, very casual. I wrote this in one sitting. I talked about these ugly acrylic paintings I make for wall art and how I like conspiracy theories, political debates, and Jane Austen.
What matters to you and why - 8/10. The content was good, but the delivery was poor. I wrote about my parents working at a Japanese grocery store and how this shaped my outlook on unpredictability/ struggle. The last lines - How can I turn my family’s narrative into one of triumph, and how will I repay my parents for giving me more than I ever deserved?
Also, in the additional information, I explained how my Interact Club raised money to build a handicapped seating area at my school. We had a Drive-In Movie night; it was super fun.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: 6/10. IB English and Creative Writing teacher. He knows I'm a hard worker, but he doesn't know me all too well. However, he's one of my favorite teachers. I'm just awkward and can't make small talk. I think this rec was okay, as he's a very good writer and is nice.
Teacher Rec #2: 7/10. AP Biology teacher. I really loved this class. I participated frequently and still talk to the teacher. However, our relationship isn't anything special, just friendly. She's also a good writer and dependable!
Counselor Rec: 8/10. She is amazing and is also one of the reasons why I think I got in. I think she overexaggerated my accomplishments, to be honest.
Additional Rec: 10/10. Another reason why I think I got in. This recommendation was from my Interact Club advisor. She knows very closely what I have done in Interact, and she made sure to detail everything. We have gone through thick and thin together.
Interview: 8/10. I haven't had any other college interviews, so I don't have a basis for comparison. However, I would give it an 8/10 because it was super casual, nothing earth-shattering. Yet, I think my interviewer liked me because I was genuine and self-deprecating. We talked about random things, not much about Stanford or my intended major really. He didn't even ask ""Why Stanford?"".

Weaknesses: Extracurriculars and that one typo (I will never live it down). Also, I was redundant about Interact.
Why you think you were accepted: I was myself, plain and simple. Admission officers can tell if you're being honest and authentic. Trust in your abilities. Trust in your uniqueness. Do not listen to the disbelievers. They don't know who you really are. Showcase all the things that make you have the potential to change the world. Most importantly - BE A GOOD PERSON. Everything you do should be intrinsically motivated or for the benefit of others. Never do something for college admissions. I didn't, and look what happened.
Where else were you accepted: Nowhere else! However, I am still going to apply to 4 more schools. I just need that closure and the ability to compare financial aid packages.
General Comments: You are more capable than you think. Two years ago, I was depressed, anxious, and generally frustrated about life. I wanted to homeschool; I wanted to just disappear.
Yet, I picked myself up. My parents, siblings, and friends pushed me to become better. I improved step by step until all of these steps led to today.
The moment I saw ""Congratulations!"" I screamed. It doesn't feel real, and it never will.
To anyone who feels they are inadequate, you most definitely are not. You are amazing. Never, ever forget that.

Reflection
Strengths: My essays and recommendations were my only source of hope haha. I believe that my knowledge of five languages, cultural richness, and dedication* could be considered as strengths as well. Also, coding and electronics are my passion, and I built many things, but nothing that would really reach out to the people and affect them...
*I know that everyone who applies to Stanford is dedicated. What I'm trying to say is that despite being thrown into Algebra II junior year, I started my senior year with Calculus II because I truly wanted to progress forward.
Weaknesses: My GPA is quite weak, but it is explainable by the fact that my freshman and sophomore years were spent in a very tough French school in Montreal. My pure American GPA is 4.0.
Why you think you were rejected: Well, many factors could have influenced my application, but probably the fact that I had nothing really ""special"" and that I did not excel in high school all four years were a con. That is, I didn't start my own company, or my own club, or truly try to influence my surroundings in any major way. I believe Stanford looks for students who have already demonstrated their ability to do so. Alas, I am just starting to develop myself in the area 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: n/a
General Comments:
I am not disappointed at all by the decision, to be honest. It took me a couple of hours of depressive thinking, but I got out of it. That is, definitely do not feel bad about a denial from Stanford. Think of it as something that you would have never had anyway.
If you are willing to apply, definitely do! You learn so much about yourself in the process, it's amazing. Do not forget to be passionate about something, genuine, and smart! Good luck, people, and may the wind of freedom blow ~~~ ",Stanford,2021

Essays (rating 1-10, details): At the time I thought all my essays were strong but rejection makes you reconsider things. Thought my Common App was an 8.5/10, talked about how I've grown up playing poker; intellectual vitality was 8/10, about my love for creative writing which may have hurt me because I didn't submit an arts portfolio; roommate was 10/10 in my opinion, wrote a rap freestyle about myself; and I thought my what matters essay was a 9/10, said that it matters to me to ride in the front of the car.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: We had a good relationship and he's known to write good recs, 9.5/10

General Comments: I usually just lurk CC, but I am incredibly grateful for all the past threads and I wanted to give back. If you are reading this and stressed out about your chances, just know that you are a luminous human being and I believe that you can succeed anywhere that you attend. An acceptance is only a doorway into the future, and a deferral or a rejection does not define you (I know it's a cliche, but it's true).

Reflection
Strengths: I applied for the humanities/arts department (i.e. not CS), 2 arts portfolios, I do what I love and I love what I do– I never did any of it for colleges!
Weaknesses: Does anyone ever feel like they are the perfect candidate for Stanford? I was just worried that I didn't do enough...
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: As I said above, I believe that I stood out due to my demonstrated interest in the arts. I am good at science and math (I skipped precalculus), but I truly have a passion for the humanities and visual arts, which is unique for a Stanford applicant. I wrote my intellectual vitality essay about art history and my what matters to you essay on language, so I definitely stressed this point.
To be honest, though, I swore I wasn't going to get in. I opened my online letter so nonchalantly, simply because I expected a rejection. I'd like to say that I know precisely why I got in (I tried to explain a bit), but when push comes to shove, I really can never be sure. Perhaps the right person picked up my application at the right time and I just got lucky. Who knows... everyone is über qualified but, in the end, the cards fall as they do. I have been humbled by this experience and, while I'm glad it turned out as it did for me, I completely acknowledge all of the wonderful people who were denied.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I didn't apply elsewhere yet (and I probably won't now)... Early action.
General Comments: To all of you who were denied entry, please know that it will work out. The acceptance rate is silly and it has nothing to do with you as a student. Don't doubt yourself because of this– you will be stronger in the end. Good luck on your other apps, but I'm sure you will end up where you belong. 
And to those applying– DO WHAT YOU LOVE TO DO AND DO IT A LOT! It will come across. Don't spread yourself too thin by being ""well-rounded"" because, frankly, being a lopsided ameba with one really fantastic, super awesome strength is just as good, if not better. GO AMEBAS!!!  ",Stanford,2021

Essays (rating 1-10, details): 10- Used the failure prompt. My entire essay was that I spread myself too thin and wasn't able to achieve any one major goal in dance, gymnastics, or school. Strong ties to the saying ""jack of all trades, master of none""!

Teacher Rec #2: 9, had the teacher for two years. The first year was a nonhonors math, and the second was an honors course. She highlighted how much I have matured in my study habits and that I have only grown stronger in my devotion to school rather than weaker.... she doesn't know I am about to have senioritis

Stanford was my reach & dream school, I subscribed all the YouTube channels of Stanford students, explored every aspect of Stanford. I did my best, and I was pretty sure I would be rejected before I saw the decision. But when I saw the decision, I was still disappointed. Anyway, It's Stanford.
My advice to future applicants? Don't be afraid to apply. Just do your best. After all, it's Stanford. It's OK to be rejected, life needs to move on. It's not the school that matters the most, but what you do in college is the most important. You will end up in a school that matches you. Enjoy life in college! ",Stanford,2021

General Comments: I've been dreaming about going to Stanford since I can remember and I'm so happy. If you are looking to apply, start now and be authentic. Look for some project to set you apart from other applicants. My brother got in because he worked to design 3D braces and prosthetics. I didn't expressly look for a project but I followed my gut and started a petition against having special needs at my school pick up trash as a part of a class. It turned into this whole research project, bureaucracy fight and in the end it was successful but that's what I wrote my essay about. I'd say grades and a good variety of extracurriculars are good to get in, but a lot of people have that. My advice is to look for something that sets you apart, that no one else has done. If you aren't sure about applying, do so anyway. Shoot for your dreams you got this. And in the long process of waiting which has been killing me the past months, just pray a lot, and then let it go. Worrying can't do much.  ",Stanford,2021

Teacher Rec #1: 10/10. Actually got to see this one! It was rlly nice and thoughtful
Teacher Rec #2: 9/10. Physics teacher is the bomb.

To everybody else who was rejected, don't feel disheartened, your achievments and the skills you've gained in the process are still very valuable. Now we have the chance to prove the adcom wrong .
Even though it didn't work for me, I still think the best thing to do is find something you love doing and demonstrate serious interest in it. Also, Admitsee is a great website if you want to check it out, along with some of the posts on PrepScholar.

Essays (rating 1-10, details): COMMON APP: (10/10)- Easily my favorite essay. I knew that the perspective I used on my chosen topic was completely unique, NOBODY else would have written it from the lens I did which makes me quite proud. Connected my background to my educational dreams and aspirations etc. I chose prompt one about sharing some of your background. Only shared it with my English teacher who also said it was great.
INTELLECTUAL VITALITY: (8.5/10)- Wrote about how taking AP Physics allowed me to see the entire world through a secret lens, almost like X-ray vision. Told it through a story that happened during a class experiment and made it very entertaining. Also connected the laws of physics to all of my other activities as well.
WHAT MATTERS: (9/10)- My second favorite essay. Instead of writing about some general quality like honesty, integrity, curiosity, etc. I wrote about the top row of bleachers in my high school's football stadium. (Basically my happy/peaceful reflection place). I used that as an example of how my home is what matters to me and how it has shaped me to be the person I am today.
ROOMMATE: (7/10)- Least favorite of the three prompts. I didn't know how to really attack the prompt in a creative way with such little space, however I shared some of my personality that wasn't reflected in my application like a love for musical theater, soy products, and dream analyzing.
EXTRA-CURRICULAR ESSAY: Talked about a grueling sand dunes practice with my track teammates that showed how our bond was strengthened through these types of experiences together. Wrote it like a movie scene in a way.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): Luckily the teachers I chose all insisted that had a copy of each letter after they hit submit (even though I waived the rights). Along with my academic strengths, every single letter highlighted my personal qualities as well. Included that of, modest, helpful, dependable, witty, cheerful etc. I was really pleased with how personal each one was, it truly is important to have a genuinely pleasant relationship with your teachers.
Teacher Rec #1:(8/10)- HONORS PRE-CALCULUS(Junior Year)- Although the letter was a little short, it was extremely flattering. Attested to my mathematical intuition and achievements, strong presence in class and other small quirks that impressed her. She's also head of the math department at my school so I'm sure that carried some clout.
Teacher Rec #2: (9/10)-SPANISH III teacher (Junior Year) - His letter was also very flowery in language and attested to my strengths in foreign language. Talked a lot about my personal qualities as extremely helpful, focused etc. Referred to me as ""the friend we should all be lucky enough to have"" and noted that I ""seem to be most at home in an rigorous intellectual setting"" etc.
Counselor Rec:(7/10) (All 4 years) Didn't read but she is an advisor in one of the club I lead so it was probably pretty good. She has 450 other students to counsel so that may have affected it somewhat.
Additional Rec: (10/10) FAMILY FRIEND/SPANISH II TEACHER/COACH) (Known him since I was three years old)- Easily my most heartfelt letter. Noted some specific instances in his class but also highlighted how he has watched me grow up since I was a kid to now as a senior. Talked about how I wanted to show him my dollhouse at 3, then sat on the sidelines in elementary, all the way to winning Homecoming Queen as a senior. It was very long, a page and a half single spaced and thorough. Couldn't have asked for a better letter from anyone else.

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I'm sure there's a bunch of reasons for a decision to go either way so I'm not sure if I can pinpoint exactly one thing. I think my voice and personality really shined through my application which is a plus when literally EVERYONE is so qualified academically.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Nowhere else yet, however I did send in UC apps already.
General Comments: Don't fall for CC syndrome! If you are afraid to apply because you have a sub 1450, DO IT ANYWAY. Been here for awhile( since sophomore year) under different names and almost did not apply because of that but I'm so glad I did. Stanford has been my dream for years and now it is a reality. You never know what makes them accept you so you might as well throw your hat in the bucket if Stanford is your first choice. (They took two from my school REA which has NEVER happened before). Also reallllly polish those essays. In my opinion, those hold the most weight in your admission decision, especially for Stanford. I wrote each one like a movie scene and really drew a picture as if the reader was there, try not to bore your audience! No matter what though, if you apply in the first place it's almost a given that you will soar no matter where you go, so stay optimistic and you'll land where you are meant to be! Now I swore off CC when I got my decisions and now is the time. If you want to talk about anything app wise, share essays etc., PM me because that's the only thing I'll keep up with, cheers!

Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected:
General Comments: Do what you want/like to do! In my country, if you plan to become a biologist (for example) you do everything connected with it and prepare for it, instead of being 'well-rounded'. 'Well-rounded' is typical, and YOU ARE N O T TYPICAL in any way, so don't pretend to be! And actually, don't listen to anyone giving you advice here, because according to these people I had no chance of getting into Stanford  Spend a lot of time on your essays but don't go crazy with them. Write from your heart and reflect on who you are, not who you want them to see you. Take risks with essays and be original, that pays off. By the way, I wrote all supplemental essays in a week the were due (intellectual vitality on October 31st lol). I am super amazed now so I can't write normally.

If I could do this over again, I would not apply early action because this was my first college app and I basically had no clue what I was doing.

Essays (rating 1-10, details): 10 for sure. I think this is what really got boosted me.
Common App: 10 - My personal statement really gave a unique perspective into my life that really seemed to connect well with the theme of my other essay questions, and was something pretty quirky. Focused on my thirst for knowledge from various aspects.
What Matters Most: 9.5- This showed how much family meant to me, and I talked about how my father's battle with memory loss inspired me to get into medical research.
Future Roommate: 12. Yes a 12. This was so much fun to write, and took the least amount of time. I went for that quirkier side, talking about how I take pictures of my meals all the time, how I always whistle songs in the morning, and talked about my gnome named G3W Terepcho (my Gen Chem professor gave me this).
Intellectual Vitality (still not entirely sure what that means): 9- I talked about my fascination with puzzles, and how I valued the diversity of perspectives on approaching problems, and how my unique ways have allowed me to really be able to help students through services like tutoring and being a TA
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): Didn’t read any but can give a pretty good estimation (Both teacher recs are Ph.D's. One received their's from Duke, and the other from Cornell):
Teacher Rec #1: 10 - This was my first college professor, and it was for majors-level general chemistry (CH 221-223). I had her for one year, and have been a TA and lab aid for her for my second year now. I am about the same age as her son, so she is almost like another mother to me. Had 100% in all her classes, and got the highest percentile on the ACS standardized examination, actually tying my score with one of the professor's who tried taking the test that year.
Teacher Rec #2: 9 - I had her for the 300-level Organic Chemistry sequence (241-243/331-333). It was a very tough class, but managed to get all A's, and I now do research with her, and it's been a blast. Like my first recommender, I am about the same age as one of her children, so she also is like a motherly figure. I also TA for her organic chemistry students this year, and her nursing/dental-major chemistry students.
Counselor Rec: 9 - My counselor and I are actually neighbors, which is really nice. He has been a big supporter of me taking college courses since the summer of my freshman year, and always keeps in touch to make sure I am progressing well in school.
Additional Rec: Didn't put any
Interview: 10 - My interview was so interesting and fun. Met at this cute coffee shop near downtown Portland, about 35-40 minutes from where I live, since pretty much every alumni is from the west side. The interview lasted over an hour, and actually ended because the next person being interviewed arrived, although she happened to be one of my good friends. We had a wonderful conversation, and I learned a lot from our time.

School Type: public
Ethnicity: Asian (Filipino)/Pacific Islander (Chamorro)
Gender: Male
Income Bracket: 150,000-160,000
Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): URM, both of my parents went to a college but never received a degree, I live in a region of the metro area that seems to always be viewed as inferior in academic performance compared to those schools on the west side that are generally wealthier and supported by former alumni.
Reflection
Strengths: I think the fact that I genuinely cared about every single one of my activities and hobbies showed, both in the interview and essays. My essays highlighted things about my personality that were interesting, unique, and quirky without sounding like a broken record. Also, taking classes at a community college including 300-level majors courses and already receiving two Associate's degrees helped. Additionally, I had lots of support from my family and friends, which really motivated me.
Weaknesses: My test scores weren't stellar. I only took them once and never studied, so I think I had the potential to score better. Only took 1 AP test, although it was because they only offered one during freshman and sophomore year, and then I went into the Middle College/Running Start program. I also don't have the extensive list of awards and am not a team captain.
Why you think you were accepted: I think that in the context of my school and situation I excelled past many expectations that people had. My essays were very strong, with my personal statement being unusual (I talked about picking apart remote controls, electrical outlets, trying to learn my parent's native languages, etc).
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I've only applied to 'safety' schools. Accepted: University of Portland, Washington State University, Coe College, Creighton University, Northern Arizona University, Pacific University. Still waiting on: USC, Washington and Lee (Johnson's Scholar Program), Washington University in St. Louis, Reed College.
Advice to Students
Don't be afraid to apply to Stanford. Even though the acceptance rate is excruciatingly low, if you show that you have a genuine interest for the things you do, then you will be on track for success, even if that turns out to be at a college/university other than Stanford. Also, watch out for the misconception of being a well rounded student. Yes, it is good to show versatility, but also focus on the things that really interest you. For me, that was becoming a chemistry TA, doing research, helping in the labs, and becoming a tutor. It's a variety of activities, but it also centers around a common theme. Make sure to unwind though, whether that involves reading books, playing music, going for drives, etc. just remember that you deserve a breather. ",Stanford,2021

- Meetings throughout Silicon Valley with technology companies after selling my first company
- Bike crash (I cry everytime...  )Essays (rating 1-10, details):
- Common App: 9/10. Talked about IP that I had designed and sold, and the failures I had along the way. Hopefully good, humble, reflective but also I had a lot of fun designing and marketing some cool stuff, so hopefully that comes through...
- Intellectual Vitality: 9/10. Talked about how meeting a Stanford Professor on aforementioned trip through Silicon Valley changed my perspective on education. I went from the New Zealand system where you pick a degree and get it done ASAP, and how I found that I preferred the American way of trying a few things and working out what you really like. Linked it into an extended metaphor about skittles quite well, I think. That sounds weird, but you have to read the essay to understand it. I'll share it once I start at Stanford.
- What matters to you and why?: 8/10. Probably my weakest. I talked about how I was inspired to try and help improve educational standards from those less fortunate than myself, so I organised a fundraiser and world record attempt, and we made a documentary about it that won a few awards. It was pretty cool what happened, but I feel like it was probably my most generic essay.
- Roommate Letter: 9/10. Tried to make it quite casual and funny. Talked about how I can't ever sleep in like a normal teenager, and how I'm terribly messy. Self-deprecating but also provided an insight into my work ethic etc.Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
- Teacher Rec #1: Chemistry - 9/10. Great teacher, got along with him really, really well. Great guy, good writer, went to Oxford so a bright cookie and would have written a great write up.
- Teacher Rec #2: Economics - 8/10. Good guy, good writer. Got along with him well, but not as well as Chemistry teacher. Would've been some good stuff, but likely cobbled together.
- Counselor Rec: 6/10. She let me read it. Pretty generic guff really.
- Additional Rec: This got me in. Can't go into detail for privacy reasons, but it was amazing. 10/10.
- Interview: Really great. Informal, conversational. We had a good laugh and I learnt a lot about Stanford, as well as communicating what I'd been up to in general terms in the pastOther:

Income Bracket: $1,000,000+
Hooks: Nothing really.Reflection:Strengths: ECs, genuine and probably original essays (mainly my Intellectual Vitality one...)Weaknesses: Probably grades. SAT is bang on the Stanford Average, and I felt I could've done better in subject tests, mais c'est la vie. Only sat the SAT once (International Student and only decided recently to go for Stanford.)Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: ECs honestly. I do a lot of work in the technology space, running a company, which really fits with the ethos of Stanford. Having sold a company fits the mantra of entrepreneurship too.Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Nowhere! Only University in America I was interested in applying to was Stanford. I got accepted with a Scholarship to the University of Sydney, which was my backup plan.General Comments:
If anyone is reading this for advice, I don't know much, but the philosophy I put into place was to make a story for myself. I wanted to show the admissions department exactly why I would fit into Stanford, and that means more than a perfect SAT or GPA. You have to give them a reason to go ""Hey, we need this guy,"". I did that with my technology, and you can use whatever you really love. That said, don't make up some fake story to define yourself, be genuine - tell them what you actually love. If it was meant to be, it'll be.
I also didn't bother talking too much about stuff I wasn't passionate about. I mentioned ECs I did, but didn't love in my EC area in the Common App, but left it at that. All my essays were passions. Can't stress that any more really.
To all who were accepted, congratulations!!! I look forward to meeting and studying with you all (Stanford is the place to go...  ).
To those who were deferred - heads up, you have a great shot in the regular round. I've heard REA is harder?
To those who were rejected - Stanford is the most selective University in the world, and there's a good deal of luck involved. Good luck for your other applications, you'll all do great. If you've even applied to Stanford, you're going to be incredibly talented and brilliant, no matter where you matriculate. ",Stanford,2021

Essays (rating 1-10, details):
Intellectual Vitality: 9/10 Talked about how an unguided dissection lab ignited my passion for using science as an interdisciplinary opportunity to study and explain the world around me
Common App Essay: 9/10 Told a story about overcoming my anxiety in order to become the best I could be, super cheesy story about overcoming but honest and emotional
What Matters to You?: 8/10 Explained how growing up introverted made me lonely and because of that I learned to value and protect other people's emotions, also mentioned the opportunities I've created to give others a voice since when I was in their place there was no one to help me
Describe an activity: 7/10 Used piano as a metaphorical heartbeat for my life that sets the pace for everything I do, grounds me when I feel lost, and has taught me to attack challenges head on
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: 7/10 French teacher who's known me for 4 years, I had a full year of one-on-one classes with her and now co-teach two of her classes. She's sweet and said tons of great things about me but I think the language started to sound repetitive because English isn't her first language.
Teacher Rec #2: Unsure of ranking because I didn't get to read the letter but I picked a science teacher who I'm also good friends with outside of school, taught me Physics, Chemistry, Geometry, and Calculus and was also the lead counselor I worked with at the summer camp
Counselor Rec: My counselor likes me and was the biology teacher that led the dissection I talked about, I'm sure it was good but I never got to read it
Additional Rec: I had my piano teacher write the additional rec because of how much I talked about piano, never read it but she really likes me and knows me outside of lessons as well because I grew up with her daughter
Interview: None offered in CA, but I think it would have helped me a lot

Reflection
Strengths: New SAT scores, probably letters of rec and writing, eclectic short answer section responses, 10-15 classes of dual enrollment
Weaknesses: Not very many EC's/awards and my school offers no honors/AP
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I think I was rejected just based on the mediocrity of my EC's and awards, I think that I could have played it up to stand out more but I just didn't know how at the time. I've definitely grown a lot since that application was sent.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Only heard back from Stanford so far, but I can update when I hear back from UC Berkeley, UCLA, UCSB, UC San Diego, USC, and USD.
General Comments:
Apply to Stanford even if you're not convinced that there's any chance you'd ever get in. I told myself for years that I'd never be able to do it, but in reality I was on par with tons of other applicants and even with many admitted students. It's not about being the 2400 kid with a 5.0, it's about having passion for learning and a determination to achieve greatness. Although I ended up getting rejected, I've had so much fun with this application and it helped me reflect on what I wanted and what I was passionate about. I learned who I really am and although I'm a lil bummed I didn't get in, I know that I'll end up somewhere awesome anyways. It's a good experience and I don't want anyone to ever back down from the challenge. ",Stanford,2021

Essays (rating 1-10, details): 6/10, my teachers and editors all really liked my essays and so did I (I used to think they were like 9/10), but now I feel like they weren't that stellar and their messages were kind of generic. My Common App didn't show my personality that well, but I think my supps really did.

Strengths: Volunteer work, rec letters
Weaknesses: Average scores and academics, no math in senior year (AP Cal was the highest level math course in my school, but I already finished it last year)
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I think my essays were too all over the place. I mean, they were good, but they didn't really contribute to an overall theme. I was trying to theme my application around how I am extremely community-oriented and my rec letters really helped that, but I only talked about caring about my community in the 'what matters' essay.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Haven't applied anywhere else yet.
General Comments: I'm pretty bummed right now, but I know Stanford only accepts + defers a small percentage of REA applicants so I'm okay. I was expecting a rejection anyway lol. I'm glad I applied REA, because this application taught me a lot of things about the college application process, so hopefully I won't make the same mistakes in the RD round. Looking back I think I should have applied to Stanford RD instead, because Stanford was my #1 school and I would have avoided making some of the mistakes I made applying REA. Congrats to everyone who got in! 
My advice to future applicants is not to let a lot of people know you're applying. I originally kept it a secret, but one of my friends told my teacher and the teacher told everyone else, so my whole school knew I was applying even though I didn't want anyone to know. They all thought I was a shoo-in, so I honestly don't know how to tell them I got outright rejected. Especially since I am the only one applying to Stanford + Ivy League schools in my school this year. ",Stanford,2021

Essays (rating 1-10, details): honestly what I think made all the difference
Common Application: 10/10 - Spent months on it, probably the best essay I’ve ever written (I'm usually the type of person who thinks everything I touch is crap). Wrote about my longstanding love for science and the many ways I have explored it through the years.
Intellectual Vitality: 9/10 - was also about science so could have seemed a little redundant. Talked about a research experience and how I was excited to uncover a problem, tackle challenges, and continue trying ideas for the future.
Letter to Roommate: 9/10 - demonstrated my knowledge of Stanford and briefly mentioned some of my favorite things about it. Then went into a talk about my conversion to a foodie and hope for our future friendship
What Matters to Me: 7/10 – could’ve been bad because it was about piano and I didn’t have a supplement. Also wasn’t too specific and was kinda stereotypical for an Asian. Wrote about how piano was a way to relax my mind and complement my science side.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): what I was worrying and freaking out about
Teacher Rec #1: 9/10 - my Organic/AP Chem teacher. I was one of her best students in her class and she loved me. Was also the Bio Olympiad Sponsor (strange I know)
Teacher Rec #2: 6/10 - my math teacher last year. I had one of the highest grades she ever had but I’m not sure if she knew me that well outside of grades and awards. I really didn’t talk to her that much so she never got to know my humor or my experiences. Probably generic
Counselor Rec: 9/10 - regularly got into touch with him and we talked a lot about college and everything I’ve done. Great guy who really thinks highly of me.
Additional Rec: Nope
Interview: 8.5/10 – Aside from a potentially dubious comment on my choice of beverage at Starbucks (peppermint mocha), it was pretty great! We talked for 45 minutes about what my interests, strengths, weaknesses, my fascination with speed, etc. The only potentially bad thing was that for my pet peeves when I just rambled something about communication. In the end, though, she told me I would be a perfect match for Stanford with my motivation and dedication.Other

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I was very genuine in my essays and didn’t try to seem to be a perfect student. My curiosity and passion for science really shown through in my essays.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Also applied to Harvard/MIT RD, will updateGeneral Comments
For people who aren’t applying this year, you still have time to get your GPA/scores to the level you want. Working on those will make you more competitive. This is pretty cliché, but don’t do things just to look impressive to colleges. They’ll know. Outside of class, my advice would be to follow your passions and develop good relationships with your teachers. You don’t have be the best well-rounded student to get in.
For seniors, the only thing in your control now is basically the essays. It would make things a lot easier to start essays early in the summer (for future years’ applicants). Personally, I spent 4 months to write what the best essays I had ever written. I’m pretty sure that with mediocre essays, I would have been a faceless Asian in a sea of impressive applicants. The essays are super important, making you not just competitive but COMPELLING. Demonstrate your interests and show them what drives you to get out of bed in the morning (excluding coffee, unless you genuinely are interested in its properties or effects on society lol).

- Always, always, ALWAYS get other people to proofread your essays. Especially people who know you well (i.e. family, close friends, a teacher who really likes you, etc.)
- Don't be repetitive in your essays. Saying something once in one essay gets the point across as well as saying it four times in four essays. You want to tell AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE in your essays, so find a way to make them all different.
- Let your own voice and character shine through.Be honest and humble, but don't be afraid to brag a bit. Just make sure you don't sound conceited when praising yourself.
- Be consistent. You don't want an application that's STEM-oriented and then say you want to be a Lit major. Or vice versa.
- Don't slack off senior year. Your senior year schedule is crucial, especially for top colleges like Stanford. They want to make sure the rigor of your senior courseload matches those of your first three years of high school.
- Build good relationships with your teachers. Not only will this help you with college applications, but it will allow you to enjoy your classes more. ",Stanford,2021

-Founded my own 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization offering free and structured standardized test prep to underprivileged high school students - to date, we've had hundreds of students in multiple states - Ohio, Virginia, Washington DC - as well as around 50 student volunteers and thousands of dollars in donations. We officially partnered with a school district and the local public library to hold workshops.
-Played piano for senior citizens at a local nursing home and also for children at a local children's hospital - created a program to connect high school students and provide them with musical volunteering opportunities.
Summer Activities: ACT tutoring, debate camp, sleeping in, playing League
Essays (rating 1-10, details):
Common App: 9.5/10 - My best essay. Wrote about the mysteriousness of doors and how I backed out into my garage door while it was still closed and got stuck, and how it inspired me/connected to create a door for others through the ACT.
Roommate: 7.5/10 - More on the generic side, shared my love for food and some of my other quirks
Intellectual Vitality: 8.5/10 - Wrote about what I'd learned from the different aspects of managing a nonprofit - opening my first bank account, filling out tedious paperwork, and educating students from different backgrounds.
What Matters: 8.5/10 - Wrote about my love for sneakers (Jordan 1's baby) and how they represent diversity, passion, and community.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: 10/10 From my 11th grade English teacher, dope letter from an inspiring dude that I was very close to - he said that I was one of the best he ever had and emphasized my leadership and community service. Gave him a big hug after I got in.
Teacher Rec #2: 9.5/10 From my APUSH teacher, never got to read, but we're tight and she's awesome so I assume it was awesome!
Counselor Rec: 10/10 Over four years, my guidance counselor and I got pretty close. She inspired me to get out more and become more social (freshman year I was a meganerd), meet new people, and create opportunities for myself. She wrote about how I helped two members of our football team improve four points on the ACT and how I was able to connect and mold my teaching style to them. Amazing letter, probably couldn't have gotten in without these.
Additional Rec: 8/10 From my Lincoln-Douglas Debate Coach, who's also my math teacher - Never got to read this one, but I worked hard in debate and we have a pretty good relationship, and I was pretty good but wasn't a state champion nor was I nationally ranked, but it was probably pretty solid.
Interview: 8.5/10 This was my first interview and it was for Stanford!! (oh god). Fortunately, my interviewer was an awesome person and was super easy to talk to. Overall, I talked a little fast, gave a cringey answer or two but we connected, it was laid-back, and I found out a lot about Stanford and how it would be a good fit for me. Ran about 20 minutes over.

intellectual vitality: 9.5 - talked about being mesmerized by eecs at a governor's school, i think my rhetoric was good
roommate: 9.5 - I feel my voice really shined through, i literally just sat down and started typing. this is the essay where stanford can best get to know you: use that that to your advantage!
what matters!: 9.75 - talked about my life and reflected on my high school experience, connected that to my future goals and what i wanted to accomplish
notes: this sounds really cliche but be yourself (go wherever the flow takes you, i quoted britney spears!)! be cautious though, i read some good advice online for finding the balance between casual and formal: write it like you're speaking to a teacher, it should still be courteous and polite yet unique
also important, get your friends to read your essays! they know you extremely personally and can provide good comments as such! i had many of my friends point out flaws in my idea development that may have ended up being extremely crucial. of course it is good to have a parent/teacher read over, but do not discount the importance of having peer review

General Comments: First off, I am very happy and honored to be accepted to Stanford, tbh I wasn't really expecting it and it was a really amazing surprise when I got the news!
I posted this moreso for the sake of potentially helping future applicants just as cc has helped me, and I hope you found this helpful!
i think the most important thing is to focus on what makes you, you! everyone talks about a spike, and they're absolutely right, go for the things you're good at it!
when you're grinding essays, a strategy i recommend is to file the prompts away in your head and continually think about them (maybe brainstorm) but do not start your essay until you are absolutely sure you're ready. once you start your essay (and feel prepared to do so!), do not stop until you put the final period on your conclusion, taking breaks can hurt the flow. be sure to use your own voice and language, don't try to be someone else! i'm sorry this was sorta rushed but if you need help, feel free to message me or whatever (I don't check CC often, but I'm happy to help)
finally, I really recommend a campus visit - it helps a lot to figure out what stanford is all about. people say this all the time, but moreso than other universities I visited, I feel like my stanford visit truly helped increase my interest and helped me discover what stanford is about. the info session was one of the best ive been to, and the campus tour was also a lot of fun!

To future applicants: don't be afraid to apply because you never what they are looking for. It's super random. And be passionate in your essays! Take time milling over what you are going to write about in your head and commit to it. Don't let your tone disappear either. And definitely don't kill yourself doing a bunch of extracurriculars/ taking 10 AP classes a year. After a certain point it won't enhance your application anymore (at least from what I've heard). Also, research the school a lot. I thought it was my dream school and when I got rejected I literally moved on in .2 seconds (I literally didn't know anything about it even though I visited twice haha). I wish I would've applied elsewhere early honestly. But nonetheless glad I applied! Sorry for the novel I just wrote, thought I would share because I've been looking at these posts for YEARS!

Strengths: scores, grades
Weaknesses: essays
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected:
* Supplemental essays were really not satisfactory - I finished the supplements in the morning that they were due b/c I procrastinated really hard
* Common App essay could have gone through more rounds of revisions
* Race
* Location
* ECs not tailored towards Stanford? Speech/debate and research were my big points, but maybe focusing way harder on and excelling in one would be better for a school like Stanford.

Accepted: Columbia, UCLA, UCSD
Waiting on rest
General Comments:
Please don't procrastinate on your essays, especially for the early round!!!! I didn't even take my own advice for the regular round and again procrastinated. But that time, I knew how to write good college essays, and looking back at them/comparing them to my Stanford ones, they were somehow really well-written despite the little time I had. But I still found one or two grammatical mistakes here and there.
Tl;dr: essays are important. don't procrastinate.
I didn't even really want to apply to Stanford early - my parents encouraged me to. But I'm glad that they did -- I can look at more choices in the regular round now than if I had gotten in somewhere ED.
Good luck everyone! ",Stanford,2021

Subjective:
Extracurriculars (place leadership in parentheses):
Listed on app:
Heart for Vietnam Children's Initiative [10-12]: Founded and directed an unofficial non-profit organization with my dad that focuses on providing educational and nutritional resources, funding WASH construction, etc. for underprivileged schools in Vietnam. Over 2,000+ impacted in four Vietnamese cities
Baltimore Youth Project [11-12): Founded and directed an initiative/club that collaborates with Baltimore City schools and organizations to develop and provide workshops, curriculum, etc,, specifically on nutrition and art for city youth.
Research at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and the Urban Health Institute [11-12]: Researched the effects of low-income and food-insecure household environments on the brain and behavior (submitted to Intel). For UHI, I helped the director find local researchers at nearby universities in order to collaborate with them. My experience at Hopkins has been great, especially since the public health school is right across the street. The conferences there really sparked my interest in public health.
Boy Scout since 6th grade: Eagle Scout, was an Assistant senior patrol leader, troop guide
Varsity Soccer [11-12]: Two year letterman, helped manage team. We were ranked #33 nationally for a while and #2 in state (#1 in state was also #1 nationally)
Job/Work Experience: I have been paid to tutor kids for test prep and also babysat my cousins since freshman year. I started a small lawn service business to raise money for HVCI.
Volunteer/Community Service: mentioned above there was a lot (1000+). Service really opened doors for me. That was what my essay was about. I have learned so much from service and it has shaped my life tremendously. I have assisted in filling cavities, taught classes in front of freshmen, served food, etc. All of these experiences helped me so much in finding my passion.
Summer Activities:
Habitat build in New Orleans after 9th grade, in eastern shore of Virginia (after 10th), visited Stanford, Boy Scout jamboree, volunteered at camp for city kids (after 9th grade)
Volunteered in a hospital pharmacy after 10th, took a public health class at Hopkins, raised money for HVCI, volunteered a lot, worked, took care of my mom, etc.
After 11th: research at Hopkins, volunteered at a camp, finding partnerships for BYP, fundraised, etc.
Essays:
Compared to the essays I sent in for Harvard, I loved these essays and short answers much more. They were so fun to write and really allowed me to show off my quirky side.
Common App: solid 9/10 I wrote about how I performed CPR on my mom in the middle of the night and took care of when she had a stroke and cancer. These experiences led me to help out at a food drive and then the rest is history. Service became very important to me and I wrote about how much it helped me understand my community and the world while pushing me to always be positive and grateful and a role model for others and in the crime-ridden community I grew up in..
Roommate Essay: 9.5/10 Wrote my essay in the format of a recipe (to really show them I have an obsession with food). Mentioned really quirky stuff like phrases I often say or how I only use plastic utensils in an effort to save water.
Intellectual Vitality: 8/10 Talked about my childhood battle with Obesity, homer simpson, anthony bourdain, leftover quesadillas, but I felt it didn't express my personality that well. It was a condense version of my Harvard supplement
What matters to you? 10/10 This essay was probably the one I am most proud of. Talked about why I love children and why giving back to my community and Vietnam is so important to me. I think I expressed it well too.
Teacher Recommendations: I didn't read any of them, so i can't say for sure
History Teacher: he’s a homie (9.5/10).
English Teacher: he’s very unconventional and English has always been my weakest class, but I worked my butt off and always had fun learning in his class (8.5/10)
Counselor Rec: (10/10) she loved me even though I switched over at the end of last year.
Interview: Didn’t have an interview and was worried because of this.

Weaknesses: SAT, lack of major awards, lack of 5's on APs, being Asian lol
Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: I think my passion for Baltimore, children, and food showed through. I had personal struggles and talked about how they changed me and made me who I am today. My recs, even though I say they weren't good, probably got me through as well.

Waiting: Princeton Rejected: None
General Comments/Advice/Hindsight: Just wanted to first say congrats to all who were accepted! I can't wait to meet you one day. For those waitlisted, there is still a glimmer of hope. You have so much to offer and will be so happy in four to five months, I can guarantee it. Never think of this as a dead end. I applied for Questbridge and was heartbroken to not be selected as a finalist. I had Stanford as my dream school and envisioned this day for so long, but after Questbridge decisions, I was not named a finalist and thought there was no way to get in. In the end, I got a likely letter which threw me off so much and I guess things have worked out so well.  Like Questbridge for me, this is a hurdle to your road to success. Don’t expect anything, there will be many speed bumps and unexpected turns, but you will end up where you are meant to be. Never give up, be yourself, love life, pray to God, and always be grateful and passionate. Being unique will always overcome weaknesses in academics. I took the SAT three times and was still lower than average for Asians at Stanford, so TEST SCORES DON'T MEAN EVERYTHING!!!
I always had hope, but there are so many people out there who deserve more this me. I just give
thanks to God and my family. I hope this post can help someone along the way. Never feel discouraged. Be proud of yourself that's all that matters! What a day and again congrats to all! ",Stanford,2020

Not going to be too detailed (no time), but son was rejected and is pretty disappointed, this was his dream school.
He has a 35 ACT, 3.9 uw GPA and some decent EC's, some with leadership roles. No hooks, no URM etc.
Congratulations to everyone who got in ! ",Stanford,2020
224,"
Also not going to be detailed, but this is for future reference because I was definitely scared about the whole admissions process, so I want to be transparent as possible for future applicants!
Rejected Asian girl w/ 36 ACT, 4.0 UW GPA, some national awards, only two leadership roles, tons of commitment in ECs. Intended major of comparative lit. Interview went ok. Not sure if my essays were great or not, but I wrote about memes, Jar Jar Binks, and MBTI (basically my passions). Deferred Princeton SCEA, waitlisted UChicago and Rice, accepted Wellesley, Pitt, UF, FSU, Pomona, waiting for Vassar and UPenn/Pton/Columbia

General Comments/Advice/Hindsight:
I feel happy that I was waitlisted, but I am kind of frustrated because of several rejections within state programs and top tier schools. I don't think it's the test score, which might seem ""low for Asian"" because I earned the 750 in each category. I've done research without a university mentor and won numerous awards (Intel) but not the BIG awards , shown passion in music with performance and leadership, been very active in my religious community, served my community especially with my focus on empowering women and children, took a wide variety of challenging courses, but it all seems meaningless to adcoms. Sorry, I don't want to be bitter.
What's the ""blemish in the armor"" so to speak, that many of my own state school's ""top scholar programs"" have rejected me? ",Stanford,2020

Essays (rating 1-10, details):
Common App: Was okay, 8/10, had to rush due to timing difficulties which was unfortunate. Talked about drawing with my grandmother and how it helped me overcome my reluctance to learn Chinese.
Roommate Essay: 9/10 Wrote about all the quirky stuff. Was like a list of what I expected my roomate to be like as a reflection of who I am
Intellectual Vitality: 7/10 Talked about my interested in innovation,design and technology during my F1 in School days.
What matters to you? 8/10 Talked about actually applying to Stanford, and what it represented - all the people who get me where I am today
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: 8/10 Volleyball coach and teacher - knew me quite well
Teacher Rec #2: 10/10 Really gave insight into my academics
Counselor Rec: 8/10

Reflection
Strengths: I think my EC's definitely stood out, especially with all my previous accomplishments
Weaknesses: Definitely SATs. I didn't have enough time to prepare for them as I hadn't decided to go to America until 1 year before deadline so everything needed to be prep'd in quite a rushed way + Australian curriculum has completely different timing to America's so balancing both was a struggle!
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected:
I'm quite sad that I got rejected to be fairly honest. Though I knew it was going to be a reach, I always held hope that my EC's would drag me through. I think my essays didn't shine through particularly well either - Stanford's essays were a bit of a jumble - I didn't have time to plan it out so it revealed all parts of myself, instead I only showed minor details. Many people get accepted with my SAT score (or even lower) so I'm not going to blame it on that entirely but ultimately, I reckon it came down to SATs and essays.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected:
Waiting on Harvard, Columbia, UPenn
Accepted: UCLA
Waitlisted: UChicago
Rejected: Berkeley, Stanford
General Comments:
Overall, this has been a really humbling experience thus far. It really gave me insight into the world outside of mine. To have seen so many people of the same age achieve so much - it really puts you in your place and allows you to wonder, what can I do? What is my impact?
I wish everyone every success - I hope that the three that I'm still waiting on will produce great results! ",Stanford,2020

Summer Activities: Wrote political satire on a website that got pretty popular
Essays (rating 1-10, details):
I began all the Stanford essays about 70 minutes before the deadline because I'm a stupid procrastinator. Hence, they were all relatively garbage-tier.
Common App: I finished this essay a few minutes before the Harvard early action deadline... But I polished it up a little for Stanford. I wrote about a challenging physics problem that I found on Reddit and how I came to the solution. Initial version was a 8/10 with many mistakes, 2nd version was a 8.5/10.
Roommate Essay: 5.5/10 BSed a bunch of crap about how I want to do a lot of things in life but don't have the lifespan to do them all. Terribly written by my own standards (which I've been told can be a little high).
Intellectual Vitality: 6/10 Talked about the necessity of looking at history from different perspectives. Also not good.
What Matters to You: 3/10 Some incoherent nonsense about opportunity that I wrote in the 8 minutes before the deadline.

Reflection
Strengths: Scores, recommendations, grades
Weaknesses: Extracurriculars, Essays, PROCRASTINATION
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Nonchalance really. I was ecstatic after receiving word that I'd been accepted to Harvard, my at the time first choice school, so I only decided to apply to Stanford because I might as well apply to the best of each coast. The deadline inched closer, and I still hadn't made significant efforts to complete any part of the Stanford part of the Common App. I only decided to do so the day of the deadline. Three hours before the deadline!!! DO NOT PROCRASTINATE KIDS. Your application will turn out to be garbage! Your chances will be ruined, and you will have an even lower chance of getting accepted than you originally did! In January, I was in the mindset of not really caring if I got accepted to Stanford or not. By the time March rolled around, I kinda cared. I wasn't too disappointed by the rejection; in fact, I fully expected it. My procrastination was probably the second biggest reason I got rejected. The first was the sub 5% acceptance rate and the ridiculously high number of highly qualified students applying.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Accepted to Harvard EA. Stanford was the only other school I applied to.
General Comments: Don't procrastinate kids. Take plenty of time to get your essays in tip-top shape for consideration to the most selective university in the world. I only miraculously got lucky at Harvard with my late essay. Don't count on luck. Count on your talents, your character, your accomplishments. Combine that with a fastidious mindset about applying to college, and you'll be set for great things. ",Stanford,2020

Essays (rating 1-10, details): common app essay 10/10 everyone ive shown it to loved it and said it was very me, the supplements were okay. i remember putting down some really obscure bands under ""artists"" in that question, roommate question was a typical letter, wanted to be at the higgs boson announcement. i think my best supplement was the what matters one, i wrote about the importance of being yourself and being unafraid to express it (as cliche as that sounds), which also tied into my common app essay and a few of the other supplements

General Comments:
MIT was my dream school, but I couldn't express myself in their application. I fell in love with Stanford after getting deferred from MIT, and I clicked with their application. Colleges' applications are designed the way they are for a reason. If Stanford or any other school is your dream school, and you're not ""this application drips with my blood and soul,"" you might not get in. If you find a school where you feel that way, your odds are way up. (it might not be your dream school. it'll be the school you're meant to attend.) I now couldn't be happier about my situation, and while MIT and other schools are great, they're not as great for me. Goodbye Dairyland, hello NERD NATION! ",Stanford,2020

Job/Work Experience: worked online over summer for acadec study material company
Volunteer/Community service: volunteer at art museum
Summer Activities: work, chilling (and having existential crises), overpriced summer programs that are generous with finaid e.g. stanford's summer humanities institute (which is gr8)
Essays (rating 1-10, details): personal statement 9/10-immigrant story, intellectual vitality 9/10-fangirled over my favorite artist who is a actually kinky freak, roommate letter was whack but 9/10-basically me daydreaming about life at stanford, what matter 6/10-eh, family stuff
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: latin teacher 9/10-cool dude, likes me, also probably my best class/grade in school
Teacher Rec #2: english teacher 7/10-didn't know all that well, but writes like a god, and i think/hope liked me
Counselor Rec: 7/10-counselor abhors me; the feeling is mutual. also my school is too big for any kind of real connection
Additional Rec: 8/10-professor from summer humanities institute!! rly short and kinda cliche but it probably helped.
Interview: didn't get one

Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): hella poor, applied through questbridge program, and i moved from china when i was ten so maybe that helped
Reflection
Strengths: good grades/scores, but that's nothing special in the stanford pool. probably the short essays?? the first two at least, idk, which in retrospect made me sound kinda ditzy, but i guess that's just who i am. Also well-roundedness with a little bit extra in art, as well as somewhat interesting background (immigrant, low-income, etc.)
Weaknesses: not all that special as a person, app was kinda rushed; also felt like my ec's were all over the place (half of it was for fun, half of it was for the resume, and you could definitely tell)
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: *shrug emoji* i honestly don't know. there are so many people who are waaaay more qualified than i am who didn't get accepted. i never had any real hope of getting in and the decision was just a really(really really) pleasant surprise. i've come to view the whole admissions process with an apathetic loathing. it's all a crapshoot in the end and, really, you'll be fine anywhere you go.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: accepted-swarthmore, williams, amherst, pomona, and local art school; waitlisted-uchicago, carleton
General Comments: (see above) also want to say more, because this feels like some kind of closure to the mess that's been my life for the past four years. i never thought i would actually be posting in one of these college results threads as accepted, much less to stanford. the thing is, i never did consider stanford until around this time last year, when i got into one of their summer programs. even then my attitude was mostly just 'loll it's probably the only time i'll get to see california for free, might as well.' until i got to the school (which is beautiful) and finished the program (which is amazing) and i realized that i was, just a little, in love with stanford. i tried to restrain it throughout the app process, knowing that the chance of even being waitlisted is slim. but i think deep down, i still had my heart set on this one place. and i can finally admit that to myself. point being, you never know what life might throw at you. that one place you laughed at when your friends brought it up, might just be your future home.
another point that i probably didn't stress enough: if you're a junior/sophomore/godforbid middleschooler looking at this and you're from a low-income/disadvantaged background, CHECK OUT QUESTBRIDGE; it's a great organization that works wonder for some low-income students throughout the admissions process and helps out many others, and has the most fun, brilliant, and supportive community

Essays (rating 1-10, details): Common App (8) because I worked really hard on them but I personally dislike my writing voice. I discussed a lot of my political views (extremely liberal), and Stanford is also liberal so it helped I guess.

Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):

Counselor Rec: I have no idea, yet probably bad because our counselors are so detached from anyone who isn't legit doing drugs and having sex all the time.

General Comments: I just have to vent that this whole selection process is complete bunk. There are so many applicants that are deserving of a spot at Stanford or at any of the other top-tier universities for that matter. There are so many kids who worked just as hard as I did all for years of high school, but didn't get in, and it infuriates me. Getting into a great college is so overrated, and although there are obvious perks from attending a great school, it's utterly ridiculous that these colleges just choose to have 5% acceptance rates to make themselves look prestigious when they could be educating more brilliant people that apply to them.

12: Music Fest Perugia in Italy; performed with orchestra, chamber groups, and solo. Attended Charles Dickens Universe at UC Santa Cruz. Also started sailing and tennis lessons, which are fun.
Essays (rating 1-10, details):
*Common App: 10/10 Format borrowed from Canterbury Tales- wrote about 2 ridiculous music-related predicaments (1st was about discovering, at 1:30 in the morning, that I had to finish learning a concerto and play it with orchestra the next day in Music Fest Perugia’s opening concert; 2nd was about having no piano to play on at a concert). After that, I tied the two stories together with a brief paragraph about spontaneity. The goal was to show my flexibility and ability to adapt, as well as my experiences at the piano.
*Roommate Essay: 5/10 Not poorly written, but classic example of ignoring the prompt. I wrote a weird, obtuse piece about my obsession with shapes (circles, triangles, squares) and some mathematical and natural ideas/images associated with them. That’s…not a roommate letter. If I could do it again, I’d scrap it and start over.
*Intellectual Vitality: 8/10 Pretty good, if a bit difficult to follow. The main idea was “changing my ideas of right and wrong”. First I talked about how my US History teacher assigned us two textbooks with differing viewpoints (Howard Zinn vs. a group of more nationalistic authors lol), then talked about music: going from a close-minded soloist to learning how to involve the audience/other players in my music. If that was difficult to understand…it was.
*What matters and why: 9/10 Another anecdotel. A friend and I started a club called Chamber Music Society, and we were trying to recruit new members; however, other music appreciation clubs overpowered us with their speakers and loud music. The idea was, it’s more rewarding to play live music than hit play on a recording.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): couldn't read 'em
English Lit AP teacher: 10/10 I think his letter was great, because I made a huge effort to succeed in his class, frequently discussing material outside of class time with him; I was rewarded with very high grades (nailed high scores on both research papers, a personal achievement) and, well, a very rewarding year.
US History teacher: 10/10 I started the year off rough, he caught me studying calc in class and cut me a B- for participation for several weeks lol. But I eventually became one of his favorite students and I ended 2nd semester with an A+, which was unprecedented.
Counselor Rec: 7/10 a cool guy, graduated from Yale, but we barely knew each other.
Additional Rec from piano teacher: 9/10 like my English teacher, he’s a great man who’s famous as a performer and teacher. I have no idea what he wrote about, but he taught me for only about 3 years, and he knows about all the competitions/festivals/etc. that I attended.

Applied for Financial Aid?: No
Intended Major: Piano performance
State (if domestic applicant): California
School Type: Private Catholic
Ethnicity: Asian
Gender: M
Income Bracket: $100,000
Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): first gen, strong in music
Reflection
Strengths: Piano, piano, piano. I had a ton of things to say about it, from winning international competitions, to performances around the world, to meeting the best artists of this generation in lessons and festivals (people like Lang Lang, Leon Fleisher, etc.). At the same time my academics were decent.
Weaknesses: Test scores and academics were nothing special, worse than most of the posts here. Lack of academic awards or activities. Lack of leadership at school. And being Asian, heh
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Music and – important – being PROACTIVE by directly contacting a professor. As part of applying for music, I auditioned for Professor Barth, who’s unique for his scholarly approach to playing the piano focusing especially on Beethoven. He really enjoyed my playing back in October, but then I got deferred from Stanford. A month ago I emailed him, reminding him who I was, re-iterating my interest in Stanford (a place where I can keep playing piano but also explore new fields like literature and science), and asking him specific questions about his work and piano studio (what performance opportunities? how many students do you have? What authors do you suggest I read about Beethoven’s Sonatas?). He replied with a VERY in-depth analysis of the Beethoven I was playing, and answered every single one of my questions. Yes, he remembered me way back from October.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected:
*Accepted: 4 UC’s (San Diego, Davis, LA, Berkeley), Northwestern, Rice (Shepherd School of Music), Carnegie Mellon
*Waitlisted: Johns Hopkins
*Rejected: USC
*Waiting for Harvard, Yale, Columbia, and Princeton.
General comments: Look through this thread and you’ll notice that test scores and class selection (the Objective section) are poor predictors of acceptance. Frankly your academics need to be at the level you see here, but that’s just the bare minimum. Even big academic awards sometimes aren’t enough (not that I had any). Getting into a college like Stanford, then, is all about your extracurriculars, most importantly your leadership and entrepreneurship. I took a different path and went extremely focused on music- racking up plenty of awards, performances, and experience, much of it on the international level. Because of this, I was in a good position to take on some leadership/entrepreneurship, like starting clubs and chamber groups (I formed and played in a piano trio for 2 years). However, I sacrificed versatility and my chance to excel at academics.
It worked for me, but barely- I was originally deferred. I think that reaching out to Professor Barth was the deciding factor- he agreed with my goal to become a “scholar-musician”, and answered my emails meticulously. I’d love to study with him.
In the end, throw yourself into anything you do, do it to the best of your ability, and CREATE. Form clubs, lead teams, go to your teacher and engage them in conversations. Find out about a Stanford professor you are interested in, and get to know them, even via email. That personal connection can be very powerful. ",Stanford,2020

Decision: Waitlisted
Objective:
SAT I: 2180
SAT II: 800 Math II, 760 Physics
IB (place score in parenthesis): predicted 45; HL math, physics, econ, french SL chem, lang lit
Senior Year Course Load: same as IB exams, only HL chem course
Major Awards (USAMO, Intel etc.): none (international student who is not familiar with award systems and language in own country), but I hold numerous school awards (I messed up in my app and forgot to include awards from competitions I have actually managed to participate in, e.g. FTC robotics awards)
Subjective:
Extracurriculars & Service: A lot (I filled out all 10 fields and ran out of space), but they're all mostly related to school/school-sponsored so I guess that looked pretty bad. Also, I guess it looks bad if you do ""too many"" activities, even if you don't intend to...
Summer Activities: I went to like this Ivy League summer school for 4 weeks, but other than that I was just enjoying life
Essays (rating 1-10, details): I can't really say. I liked them because they were the quirkiest I've written but may not have been what the admissions officer liked. I don't have these life-changing anecdotes and I'm not a creative writer--I mostly read non-fiction.

Income Bracket: Upper middle
Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): none really, I guess my family used to be poor, but through hard work we got wealthier??
Reflection:
Strengths: academic achievements, no financial aid
Weaknesses: ethnicity. extracurriculars. I really enjoyed them, but I couldn't express it on paper which made me seem quite superficial I think. I also could have tried to do more outside of my school and it's my fault that I ended up staying in this bubble.
Why you think you were waitlisted: Not good enough--my holistic applications just can't match all the others, which are amazing. I'm reading through them and I'm like saying to myself: ""wow they really deserve it"".
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I was rejected MIT EA (my dream school) lol so I kind of gave up afterwards, but then acceptances came rolling in: 4 UK unis (incl. Maths @ Cambridge), UChicago, Brown Likely letter and now I'm waiting for Harvard next week (no high expectations though--see you on the Harvard decisions thread)! To be honest I didn't expect to get into Stanford. I knew admit rates would go below 5% this year so I'm happy that I tried  I don't think I will accept the waitlist place...

(Additional Info)
-My GCSE and IGCSE examination grades (taken between June and July 2013) are as follows:
-International GCSEs: 6A*s in Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Mathematics (taken 6 months early), English Literature, English Language
-GCSEs: 2A*s in Theology & Philosophy and Music, and 2As in Art and French. (8A*s and 2As overall)
In the Rugby VIIs county tournament of 2013 we won First place, and thus represented Sussex in future tournaments.
-Our percussion section of the marching band was asked to perform a Splits performance in the Mansion House in 2014, and we have also been asked to perform in various other events (memorials and weddings primarily).
-I was awarded the Sixth Form Philosophy Scholarship in 2013.
-I have traveled to various recording studios in South East England to record drum kit and flute primarily over the summer and Christmas holidays of 2015.
-I am also self-taught on the piano.
-Consistently achieved perfect effort grades from year 10 onwards (straight 5.00 averages- 5 being best effort and 1 being the worst).
Job/Work Experience: Have been employed at LA Fitness until we got bought out, so now work at Darlings of Chelsea
Volunteer/Community service: Volunteered at home in local charity stores, at school with a club, and also went busking on my snare drum in Wales for the RSPCA
Summer Activities: Not much other than study, music, and volunteer work. We don't really have summer stuff in the UK like the US does
Essays (rating 1-10, details): CommonApp = 7 or 8/10, kinda generic but definitely conveyed my passion for political philosophy. Supplements = 7 or 8/10 as well... were kind of bold and certainly reflected my personality well to be fair but I know could have been better
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: Probably very nice and sycophantic I suppose, very close teacher. But I felt like he was trying to do me a favour by writing in that manner rather than writing about who i really am I guess
Teacher Rec #2: Never saw, probably more accurate about my personality even though we weren't as close as my other rep
Counselor Rec: Never saw. I think he hates me.
Additional Rec: N/A
Interview: Really good actually. Although my school put me in a bad light because I can't pay the school funds at the moment (despite them claiming they're a charity school). They told my interviewer I wasn't allowed on campus and that I ""would know why..."", so the interview started off kind of like an interrogation to find out why. But after that he was kind of laughing in surprise about my achievements and what I've done. Quite the turn around.

Strengths: My music arrangements on my website were probably my strongest aspects (i.e. that made me stand out the most I guess)
Weaknesses: SCORES. As I said above, it was a really difficult time for me to prepare for the SAT. We couldn't afford any tuition, my parents were divorcing, we almost lost the house multiple times, my long distance gf broke up with me, and I had a bout of depression and so did my brother haha. Obviously I didn't explain all of that in the email I sent Stanford, but I gave some contextual information.
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Financial Aid probably didn't help seeing as I need a full ride. My scores in the SAT and the IB were way lower than anticipated. And the fierce competition is the icing on the cake I guess

Letter to roommate was basically about all the things I wanted to do at Stanford - so potentially a bit off-topic but I think it showed why I would be a good fit for Stanford and how I would take advantage of Stanford (7/10?). Intellectual vitality tried to convey the way I think about random things (8/10?).

Appeared on local news station and petitioned to the Mayor and City Council Members. Collaborated with the Police Chief and several metroplex health specialists. Ordinance was eventually passed and implemented in November.
Summer Activities: Summer before 11th grade, I attended Stanford Pre-Collegiate Summer Institutes for Bioscience and researched mechanisms for contagious cancer. The summer before senior year, I attended [email protected] where I learned bioresearch methods such as protein assays, Western blots, etc. I used this as a springboard to work in a lab back at home researching neuronal plaque formation in Alzheimer’s Disease. I also interned with the Fire Department and rode out on Engine One for Medical Calls.
Essays (rating 1-10, details): As Stanford has been my dream school since 8th grade, I began my essays super early. I heard that Stanford valued the essay portion the most so I made sure that each section was as close to perfection as possible. I probably did five drafts for each portion (including the short responses!). Compared with what I sent Harvard (and I got in), my Stanford essays were by far superior.
Common App Essay: (9/10) This was “My Story” and it was very well written. It discussed my political activism after a bike-auto tragedy occurred in my community, and how I took the initiative to pass an updated bicycling safety ordinance. Perhaps it was a little too factual, but I thought this essay had to be meticulous given my months of work on this project.
Intellectual Vitality: (10/10) I focused on my internship as writer for an international online news agency geared towards kids. I talked about the difficulty in simplifying complex scientific concepts so that they are easily comprehensible to a child, and how that has helped me connect-the-dots and simplify concepts in my own life.
Roommate Essay (10/10): Hands down my favorite one. It was true to myself and my personal sense of humor. I mentioned my weird habits such writing sentences right to left to avoid a smudge on my left writing hand and pacing and talking out loud to myself when I study. Also talked about my family, including my sister who works for the FBI.
What Matters to you and Why (10/10): Modified this one from my Harvard app. Essentially this discusses my difficulty with my delayed maturity. It was beautifully written, as I interlaced the entire piece with a metaphor about flight. I ended the piece by including myself as a voice for the younger generation and how we should believe in ourselves and in our capacity to accomplish our dreams.
Short Responses: Each on of these was deliberately crafted, as there are only 50 words you can write max. My favorite one was the five words you get to choose. One of mine was “wabi-sabi” which is Japanese for embracing the beauty in imperfection ☺
Teacher Rec #1: (10/10) From my APUSH teacher who LOVED me. I read it afterwards for scholarships and it was amazing. He and I were pretty close as I was on his UIL Political History team as well, which he talked about extensively.
Teacher Rec #2: From my AP Calculus AB Teacher. I didn’t read it but she liked me so I believe it was good.
Counselor Rec: Excellent. My counselor has helped me in so many ways, and our relationship is extremely close, as she helped my family overcome a tragedy last year.
Additional Rec: From the Superintendent of my school district. My family and his are friends and the recommendation provided another facet to me.

Strengths: My essays by far. Once over a certain threshold, the test scores, SATs, ACTs, GPAs, 123s are meaningless. What matters is your voice and what you can contribute to Stanford. I believe my essays accomplished that. I also submitted a video, which included my experiences in both dance and cheer. This definitely helped provide a more comprehensive view of my identity.
Weaknesses: Lack of Major awards, getting published, curing cancer, accomplishing the ridiculously implausible, if not impossible things that some applicants end up accomplishing. (I truly am amazed at what people my age are doing. Makes me excited for the future ☺)
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I had luck on my side. Also, forgive me for being a little superstitious, but I submitted the app on my lucky number (11/25) and I got the decision back on my lucky number (3/25). Obviously that didn’t cause my acceptance, but it has reinforced my faith in its numerical serendipity.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Accepted at Harvard, Stanford, Vanderbilt (full ride), UCLA, UCSD, University of Texas (Forty Acres Finalist), and TCU
General Comments: Wow. I still cannot believe I’m part of the 4.69%. As Stanford has been my dream school for so long, it is amazing that I actually got in. To future applicants, don’t give up hope. Work super hard on your app to give yourself the best shot. After that, hope for a little luck. That’s what everyone needs these days. ",Stanford,2020

Extracurriculars (place leadership in parenthesis):
Listed on app:
Debate Club [9-12, President during 11-12]: Intra-school club that fosters an environment in which students can defend their positions on various topics. (360 hours total) Fencing [11-12]: School team (100 hours total)
Theater/Drama [9-12]: I played a chorus member in ""Guys and Dolls,"" Herrick in ""The Crucible,"" Boatswain in ""The Tempest,"" and Macbeth in “Macbeth” (384 hours total)
Successful SF Kids Co-President [9-11]: This program takes students from my independent school to a low-income public school once a week, and has them tutor these kids in numerous subjects. (270 hours total)
Kung Fu [9-12, Blackbelt]: Weekly Kung Fu practices at the academy and at home, with occasional tournaments (I have won several awards, including a first place trophy). (320 hours total)
Admissions Ambassador for HS [11-12]: I work open houses, speak on parent and student panels, represent my school at high school fairs, give school tours, and interact with applicants. (60 hours total)
Job/Work Experience:
Substance Cataloguing at Biotech firm [9-10]: I catalogued the various substances and chemicals at this Biomedical firm into a newly appointed state system, and generally helped manage inventory. (120 hours total)
Volunteer/Community Service:
Non-profit Admissions Board [11-12): Responsibilities include interviewing low-income middle schoolers for this tutoring non profit, reading applications, and deciding whether to admit. (108 hours total)
English and Math Tutor [9-11]: During trips to India, I tutor children in Gurgaon (small city outside Delhi) and Dharavi (slum in Mumbai) in mathematics and english. (300 hours total)
Summer Activities:
During the summer of 2013, I visited family and tutored kids in India, and then returned home to work at a Biotech firm, as explained above.
During the summer of 2014, I interned at an international observatory in Chile - I helped in their library (yes, I went to Chile to be a library volunteer), redesigned part of their website, and attended various lectures with all sorts of renowned scientists who humbled me greatly. I then came back to America to take Linear Algebra + Diff Eq at UCLA, which I completed in the top quartile (tbh, probably the top decile) of my class.
During the summer of 2015, I studied theoretical physics + astronomy at the Harvard Summer School. Noted this, but couldn’t submit the grades (sucks too, because I got As in both classes).
Essays (rating 1-10, details):
Common App [9/10]: I was really proud of this essay, as it attacked the dismissive undertone of the word “talent” (i.e. when someone says you’re so lucky because you’re “talented” in an area, they effectively diminish all the effort you’ve put in). I used this argument to segue into how I’ve built up my math considerably, and how much I enjoy math for its puzzle-solving nature.
Intellectual Development [7/10]: Used feeling airsick in a plane with a barf bag as an extended metaphor for some physics revelations, which I soon realized were inaccurate because I hadn’t learned enough yet - end message was that I still had more to learn. Generic, but innovative I guess.
Roommate [10/10]: I’m just going to toot my own horn on this one - it was amazing. I basically wrote about how I was sending my roommate specific objects that he would need to live with me (i.e. shoe inserts, earplugs, etc.), and then gave reasons for why he would need said objects to show my personality.
What matters to you [9/10]: Talked about how I got into tutoring, and how I felt “selfishly-satisfied” by helping others. Transitioned into talking about less fortunate kids I tutored, and how I helped enable them to teach themselves through technology by starting laptop drives. Finished by talking about how I planned to expand this program on The Farm.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1 [9/10]: Math teacher. He taught me everything from Multivariable Calculus to AP Statistics to Non-Euclidean Geometry. We’ve had our ups and downs, but I know that he really cares about how I do, so I’m sure this was great.
Teacher Rec #2 [7-10/10]: English Teacher for 1 semester/Academic Dean. So I’m not sure how this recommendation was, as I only had this teacher for a semester. That being said, I know I was probably the top student in her class, and my college counselor told me that she writes amazing recommendations, so this could’ve been really solid.
Counselor Rec [10/10]: He was an admissions counselor at Stanford, and he’s one of the most-informed people I met, so I feel like he would’ve written a great recommendation. Plus, I know that I’m basically his favorite student in the grade, so I’m sure this was amazing.
Additional Rec [8/10]: UCLA Linear Algebra + Diff Eq. Professor. I was the youngest student in the class by far, but I know I was one of the top students (we were told the final grade distribution in the class). Apparently, he was a big deal at MIT some years ago when he was an undergraduate, and wrote about how impressively competent I was by comparing me to that environment. My college counselor read it, and said it was great.

General Comments: College admissions is really a crapshoot, and I guess it didn’t work out for me this time. I thought I might have a shot once Chicago came through, but I guess I was wrong. It sucks to know how much emphasis schools put on certain GPA thresholds (they never say this explicitly, but given the statistics Stanford releases each year, it’s clear that they can only take so many kids with GPAs in a certain range). That being said, I have more decisions to face on Ivy Day - who knows what’ll happen (probs rejection though). Stanford was a dream so I can’t say that I’m not bummed - congrats to all who got in!

General Comments:
Make sure that you pour your heart and soul into your essays. They give a really good indicator of who you are, which is super important because at these top schools, a majority of people who apply qualify and the schools are looking beyond just 'scores and stats' to find genuinely interesting people who they feel will contribute significantly to their classes. Do not just write a basic essay and tweak it to kinda fit all your schools. I feel that one of my strengths may have been that I wrote unique essays for each school. While doing so, I was also able to get a good idea of whether I personally viewed each school as the right place where I would want to spend the next four years! Good luck! I know the process of applying is arduous, but it can also be extremely rewarding and will help you to learn a great deal about yourself! ",Stanford,2020

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I am SHOCKED I was not rejected. I feel like celebrating. But I'm not even sure if getting waitlisted is a good thing!? I'll definitely accept my place though... although I know I won't end up making it 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: The enigma of life.
General Comments: Wow. What a difficult process this was. I hated myself through every second! I thought I messed up 100X worse than I actually did and cried myself to sleep so many times.... Great job everyone who was accepted
To everyone who was rejected: this process is sooooooooo uncertain and painful. Just trust that whatever ends up happening will work out great, as long as you keep pursuing what you're passionate about.

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I thought about everyone I know who has been accepted to Stanford in recent years, and they are all hard-working, talented, intelligent, but also personable and balanced. My friend who was just accepted wrote an essay connecting memes to her love of languages. And that's not who I am, and that's okay.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Accepted at MIT (EA), UC Berkeley (early), UCLA, USC (full-ride finalist), University of Washington Seattle, University of Oregon ($15k/yr scholarship money, full-ride finalist). Waiting on Harvard, Princeton, and UPenn.
General Comments: I was completely heartbroken initially. Stanford was my top choice and I had this entire plan laid out--go to Stanford, major in CS + English, join a Silicon Valley start-up. But that was just my definition of success, not what I truly loved. In the end, I am who I am and Stanford just doesn't think I'm the right fit for them. Sure, I could've maybe helped my chances by applying early, applying as a Comparative Literature major, made my essays more light-hearted, but I would've gone to Stanford because it's the most elite, because it's the place with the 4% acceptance rate, and not because it's right for me.

Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: Admissions probably rolled two dice and I got a Yahtzee (kidding). I don't think any one prevalent factor led to my acceptance (besides luck, lol.). I think it was a combination of decent awards, competitive stats, good essays, depth in extracurriculars, and very good recs/interviews.

General Comments/Advice/Hindsight: Be a holistic applicant, but don't stretch yourself out too thin. For those of you who are killing yourselves to get involved in as many things as possible, STOP. I see the most success (myself included ) in people who choose a few areas, and develop a passion/truly excel in them. The kids who are very competitive in everything- Sports, music, debate, you name it- but don't get very far in any one area, are much more stressed out and much less outstanding. And of course, you need a very good core as well (GPA/SAT). Without a solid cake, frosting won't do you much good. Other than that... I'm an extremely lucky bastard. Lots of other kids who were very well qualified, some more than me, were either waitlisted/rejected too. I don't know what to say other than, I'm extremely grateful to be now a part of such a wonderful group of people, and I wish the best to all of you  ",Stanford,2020

Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected:
- Accepted to Princeton
- Rejected from MIT
- Waitlisted from Duke
General Comments: So I think the most important lesson I garnered from such a long, drawn-out (and sometimes horrifying) process is that the result is simply just a copied-and-pasted letter (a digital one, in fact). Prior to beginning any of my college applications, I reflected on the tumultuous journeys of myself and of my classmates, and I couldn't help but to notice how there have been so many pressures that have alienated us into believing and subscribing to such a superficial dream of what ""success"" really is. Thus, I took the entire admissions process as a source of inspiration for myself, and only myself. My essays mirror that of a senior thesis of any college student, and they weren't written with the intention of impressing the admissions officers (bragging is quite useless and unnecessary), but rather with the genuine desire to cohesively put together the snippets of my own story. And I think that, if an institution is compelled and intrigued with your story, it'll check its acceptance marks. If not, then there isn't a compatibility, and that's totally okay. And if you have no story at all, I plead you to go write it for the sake of knowing yourself.

In the ""note to future roommate"" essay, I wrote about how I am used to sharing a living space with my sister and how we will hopefully get along better. In the ""what matters to you and why"" essay, I wrote about how as a student journalist, integrity matters the most to me.

General Comments:
Everyone needs to read this that is thinking about applying to Stanford this year, ESPECIALLY if you are a minority/low income/whatever. I am living proof that you do not need to, I don't know, have a 5.00 GPA, start a Fortune 500 company at the tender age of 6, win a Nobel Peace Prize, be the leader of every single club at your school, and/or perform a successful open-heart surgery under pressure. No one at my school has been admitted to Stanford in years, and this year we had 2 students (including myself!) get in. I do not have the best test scores. I do not have the best extracurriculars. I have not visited the entire world building houses for poor communities or whatever (though that sounds like great fun). College admissions counselors want a good story. I came from a low-income family of immigrants, I have faced difficulties due to my sexual orientation, I live in an area not necessarily known for its safety, and yet I still am doing pretty well. I might not even go to Stanford because I genuinely was not expecting to get in and already had my heart set on UC Berkeley (the atmosphere at Cal just feels so much more right to me than Stanford's - talk about competitive! Though if Malala Yousafzai goes to Stanford after all I might just change my mind...) so this was a heart attack to me. Please do not freak out about not getting into Stanford or any college you had your heart set on: college is 4 years of your life that you will make the most out of anywhere you go. Not to mention Stanford's acceptance rate will probably gradually lower itself to 0% as the NYT suggests, haha. ",Stanford,2020

Strengths: Essays. Essays are your chance for your counselor to get to know you. When he/she goes in front of the adcom, they need to be willing to fight for you, so you have to be relatable and close with your counselor through your essays.
Weaknesses: Not enough AP classes. Realized this too late.
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I was probably deferred because my lack of EC activities and my lack of APs. Important note for deferred applicants: Being deferred is a second chance. I polished my EC activities to align more with my essays, so that the deferral update provided substance behind my application.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Accepted to Columbia, Johns Hopkins Woodrow Wilson Fellow, USC Trustee Scholarship, Barnard, UC Berkeley, UCLA, UC Irvine Regents, UC Davis Regents, UC San Diego Regents. Rejected from Harvard, Brown, Yale, Princeton. LOL.
General Comments: For all you deferred applicants and pessimists, don't give up. There is always a chance! I went through extreme anxiety, panic, a few breakdowns, etc., but things will always work out, no matter which amazing college you choose. Take a few deep breaths.

Recommendations:
AP Calculus - I love my calc teacher, but I bet you he wrote about me falling asleep in class and other random stuff that he thought was funny.
AP Micro/Macro - My econ teacher showed me her rec after decisions came out and it was amazing.
Counselor rec - INCREDIBLE. I have a really great relationship with the guy and I think it really showed. He also showed me my rec after decisions came out; he used descriptions like ""trend setter"" ""innovative"" ""a leader among her peers"" ""fun-loving"" ""inspirational"" and ""a good friend."" to describe me - it was like no other letter I've read before.

Reflection: I didn't start thinking about college until fall of senior year really, and so I really didn't know what I was doing. My counselor basically told me I had two options: State-School or military. So I was basically on my own guidance wise. I didn't even know SAT scores were a big deal so I didn't study (Dont do that!) and I didn't even know what the SAT II was until I started applications (had to take them in January...last minute...) But things still turned out alright. I think my case, and plenty of others, prove that you don't have to play into the ""college game"" to get into a school you love. You don't have to have legacy, or be a URM, or have the last name Rockefeller. You don't have to cure cancer. You don't have to go to some feeder school or take SAT prep classes. I was a typical student that loved to learn and did stuff that she liked and it worked out for me. I didn't get into every school I applied to, but who cares, I got into the one school I loved.

Why you think you were matched/not matched and general comments:
Strengths: Essays for sure. I was at a Stanford admissions talk and one of the panelists said ""If you were to leave your personal statement on the floor at your school and one of your friends picked it up, would they know you wrote it?"" That was perfect advice for me at the time. I think my voice shined through in each of my essays.
Weaknesses: Test. Scores. However, I will say that my acceptance is proof that you are not just a set of numbers to them! Sure, 700 USH is eh. 660 SAT Math is bad. 2 on AP Physics seems like a mortal sin. The point is, have faith in yourself.
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: It was God, honestly. And the essays.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected:
General comments: The ONLY reason I’m posting this is to encourage applicants with less-than-beautiful test scores to KEEP ON GOING. Don’t lose hope! Don’t let low test scores discourage you! Just look at my SAT math score, feel better about yourself, and then plow through! And for the essays and short answers … I would be lying if I say I didn’t heavily scrutinize my short takes, like the “favorite books/movies” questions. In the end, I realized all I needed to do was be honest. As for the 250 word essays, I tried to show my quirky/curious side. I literally wrote about snails for one of them (in a science-y way, but still). I think my essays made up for my lack of decent scores (at least by CC standards). I believe in you!

Essays (rating 1-10, details): 6, not a good writer. If I accidentally left my essays somewhere and someone who knew me read it, they wouldn't know I wrote it. I did my best on this part though.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: 7, I didn't read it. I'm not sure if it was a 7, could be worse or better. I know the teacher likes me and they are a good writer. The college information person at my school liked it.
Teacher Rec #2: 7, I didn't read it either, so I'm not sure about my rating. I know the teacher loves me. College information person at my school liked it. This teacher was my sophomore teacher, and that could have hurt me, but you can never tell with these things. She got two people in the past two years to Princeton and Yale. She was the sophomore teacher of the one who went to Princeton.
Counselor Rec: 7, he was really excited about his letter, so I'm sure he did a good job. I didn't read it though. The college information person at my school liked this too.
Additional Rec: 9, this guy was a retired economics teacher who taught me economics outside of school. His letter had a few typos because they escaped him, but the content put me in a really good light as somebody who went out of their way to learn more.
Interview: 8, both of us were engaged in the interview the whole time.

Strengths: Good ACT score, good GPA & transcript
Weaknesses: No SAT IIs, Activities not focused on leadership
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Combination of lack of SAT II, activities, and possibly my recs (although I don't think they were negative). Also, this is my Post-Graduate year because I started high school early. I also had to leave the country in my junior year because my grandmother, who lives in India became ill..

Strengths: My essays, standardized test scores
Weaknesses: Extracurriculars were generic and made me wish I had more accomplishments in high school. My AP scores were also poor in some areas, and I wish I took the time to explain in the additional comments section why.
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Honestly, it's Stanford. You can't really expect much from a school with a five percent acceptance rate.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Nothing yet. It was restricted early action after all.
General Comments: I'm a little disappointed, but I kinda expected it. I still hung on to that little sliver of hope until the end. But I'm a firm believer in that everything happens for a reason, and if it takes getting rejected from Stanford and getting accepted into a school I meant to go to, then so be it. I can honestly say I'm glad I gave it my all and tried, and I'm eager to find out where it is I'll be spending my next four years at. Congratulations to those that got in, and to those of you who may be reading this as a reference for the future, I come bearing one piece of advice: a college education is what you make of it, and a college doesn't define you. Everyone has in it in their ability to find success, and I'm 100% certain we will all find our little place to achieve just that.  ",Stanford,2020

Scores and numbers are not everything! Do not let those things keep you from applying anywhere. I almost didn't apply because I was 99% sure I would not get in and it would've broken my heart. Although I later realized that I would be ok with getting rejected, I got in despite my numbers. You miss 100% of all shots you don't take.

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Most Asians who apply for stem have a long list of awards that I don't have.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: none yet fingers crossed!
Note: Stanfrod EA has the lowest acceptance rate by far out of any University (even Harvard has 14% or something like that). To those of you who made it, CONGRATULATIONS! And to people like me, just know that one day you will probably be thankful that you didn't go to Stanford because the friends you will meet in college would not have known you if you had gone to Stanford. Also, you miss 100% of the chances you don't take so I think it was a great learning experience.

Essays (rating 1-10, details):
Roommate: Very quirky, I talked about how I love puns and told a story about how I made a pun about mayonnaise, and ended saying ""Don't worry, I'll make sure to ketchup on my puns, I only hope you'll have mustard the courage to relish them by the time we meet."" 10 if they love silly jokes like the kind I make, probably a lot worse if they don't.
Long essay: I'd say a solid 8-9. Talked about how I have severe eczema and basically how that's prevented me from doing a lot of stuff with my life, but it also allowed me to discover what I love to do and am good at doing. The teacher who read over my essays said it was really good, and she was my ap lang teacher.
What matters: Probably a 6. I kinda rehashed the whole ""I love to learn"" thing that I talked about in my vitality essay, which I think I wrote better. This one talked about how I always ask questions.
Vitality: Maybe a 7-8? Better than my what matters essay (as I said). I talked about how I have never won anything in the Academic Decathlon yet but I keep trying.

Reflection
Strengths:
Weaknesses: Low SAT. Never did anything spectacular. Am from a small school in CA where what I have done is considered pretty great, but in comparison to places with more opportunities, I haven't done much, so I'm not an impressive applicant.
Why you think you were rejected: Not good enough for Stanford, in the end. Too much going against me, too many other applicants who I guess were better.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I applied REA so I won't know any other college decisions until I find out about SJSU in late February.
General Comments:
I expected as much, with the low acceptance rate at all, but it still hurt a lot to know all my dreams of joint majoring and all that were crushed. I decided if I didn't get into Stanford that I'd apply to Santa Clara University in hopes of getting a good merit scholarship from them (as a replacement for good financial aid I could have gotten from Stanford). Congratulations to everyone out there who got in, because I'm sure that in the end, you deserved it, and I hope you can all do great things with your life.
For me, though, it's time to move on.
EDIT: I accidentally typed 2141 for my SAT superscore instead of 2140 somehow, whoops!
EDIT 2: After putting so much of my knowledge of myself into college apps, I've forgotten what I've done. Added two awards (they're not super big but one is a state award and another is national, so yeah). I hope I haven't forgotten anything else XD ",Stanford,2020

Strengths: IMO, the strongest part was the entire MITES experience (wrote an essay on it, got a research opportunity, and got amazing rec letter) and how I showcased my passions in my essays; I recommend brainstorming the point you are trying to get across with your application (ie- a girl trying to escape the binds of a patriarchal society, a boy trying to escape the endless cycle of crime in his neighborhood, a kid with a love for the things unknown, etc.) and try to weave this idea across your app.
Weaknesses: SAT II scores, some AP scores, Interview beginning, my Spanish essay could've been brushed up
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I believe I conveyed my aspirations and beliefs across the entire app so that the admit team had a clear idea of who I am

It was really creative - I talked about how I'm really tall and could make you uncomfortable as my roommate, but I'm also tall in terms of character and whatnot. Sounds a bit cheesy, but I made it pretty witty and it really sounds like my voice.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: Didn't read any of my teacher recommendations, but one was from my AP Biology teacher, who's known me for a while and has also seen my recovery from my ACL tear and has come to some of my volleyball games. My other teacher was my French teacher, who had also wrote my sister's recommendation (she goes to Duke). She was definitely the teacher I was closest to and knew me the best, not just in class but overall as a person. So I'd give my recs a 9.5/10
Teacher Rec #2: See above
Counselor Rec: Didn't read it, but she knew me pretty well, which is surprising because at my school, a lot of students don't have a close relationship with their counselor. 9/10
Additional Rec:
Internship Mentor - my mentor at George Mason University wrote one for me and it highlighted our research and our plans for a paper and a future company. 10/10
Piano Teacher - I submitted an art supplement, so my piano teacher was required to write a letter for me. It was honestly the nicest thing anyone has ever said about me. I've been with my piano teacher for 13 years now and she's practically like a second mom. 10/10
Interview: Went really well! I was paired up with a doctor at John Hopkins University. He was extremely nice and we had a great conversation. However, I've heard that the interview is mainly to check to make sure you're not crazy or something, so I don't know how much it actually contributed to my overall application.

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: My scores are lower for Stanford, I'm pretty lazy so that lead me to a few B's in high school and I got another because my Uncle died before Finals last year, I don't really have any hooks and I don't think that my essays were probably very good, Not to mention that Stanford is kind of a crapshoot even if you're the most talented person on the planet.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Stanford is my first to hear from obviously, but I'm waiting to hear back from UCLA, UC Berkeley, UCSD, UCSB, UCSC, UC Davis, Yale, Harvard, Columbia, NYU, Johns Hopkins, and Humboldt State
General Comments: I didn't really expect to get in and I'm not really that upset about it, but I'd be lying if I said that it wasn't disappointing, because I know that I'm a better applicant than my application shows, granted everybody probably feels like that and plenty of people far more qualified than me are probably receiving their rejections right now. To everybody that got in, good for you and have a great time at Stanford. To everybody that didn't, this isn't the end wherever you get in you are going to have an incredible time in college and in a few years you probably won't even care that you didn't get in.

Summer Activities: Spent the summer volunteering at the elementary, and went to Cuba to see my family for a month after two years of not seeing them.
Essays (rating 1-10, details): Probably a 9/10. On my Common App I talked about how immigrating marked my transition into young adulthood. The roommate one I talked about my usual things like how I listen to classical music but sing a combination of old Cuban boleros and today's hits. The intellectual vitality I wrote about gaining confidence back through the tutoring program, and for the what matters to you and why I wrote about education and how it helps me develop my own identity and position.

Reflection
Strengths: My essays were all about me, me and me. My English teacher told me that my essay had to be one that anyone could recognize as mine instantly. My recommenders were strong. ECs were strong as well. I had also done about 30 credits in Dual Enrollment, and I sent my transcripts from the College.
Weaknesses: I don't think my scores were high enough, but I was tired of testing.
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I think I got accepted because in my essays I tried to incorporate who I was while adding all the aspects of my culture and my unique immigration experience. I did all of this avoiding a sob story because I didn't want have the admissions committee pity me, but see that I was stronger because of my experiences.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I have been accepted at FIU (where I do dual enrollment), and I haven't applied nowhere else for now.
General Comments: I am extremely surprised and I had to have more than three people confirm that I was reading right. Nevertheless I think there are people more qualified than me.

Personal Statement: 9; I really liked my essay, but I honestly thought they would see it as being super cheesy, because it was focusing on my status as an immigrant. I had a whole Newton's First Law angle and said that the force that guided me throughout the variables in my life was math.
Short Essay #1: 9; for the intellectual vitality question, I focused on graphic design and how I it was an exploration of both my identity as well as the person I was creating it for. I liked the idea but again, super cheesy (cringe-worthy honestly).
Short Essay #2: 8; the letter to the roommate was very standard. Didn't try to be unique or weird; I just went for it and wrote an honest-to-god note, and I thought it was pretty good.
Short Essay #3: 10; I wrote about my Mickey ears collection and how Disneyland was basically what I strove to achieve in preserving happiness and stuff. It turned out pretty well and was my favorite of the three I wrote.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: 10; I adore my math teacher/CSF advisor, and I really think it was her recommendation that pushed me over the top to becoming accepted.
Teacher Rec #2: 10; my Junior English teacher is such a crack-up with her dry humor, and I think I left a good impression in her class because I was always super engaged and out there.
Counselor Rec: 10; my AP Euro teacher wrote it since he's also our counselor and IB Coordinator, and he's a terrific teacher that I truly admire.
Additional Rec: 10; my MUN advisor is super awesome (we love to share our love for musical theater), and I think she probably talked about the stuff I've contributed to our yearly MUN conference.

Reflection
Strengths: Besides being a competitive applicant in numerical terms, I think it came down to my essays. I made sure to showcase a different bit of myself in each one. My ""What Matters to You"" was my activist, would-be professor side: the impactful person I would like to be one day. My ""Roommate"" essay was silly, nerdy, and straight-up punny. I wrote about CS:GO and watching anime; cooking and listening to K-pop. I was discouraged by people because it was ""too casual"", but that's what I wanted. I wanted to show them who I was outside of school, and how even there I have an eclectic and open-minded range of interests. I'm a person: a wacky, silly, nerdy person; to portray myself otherwise in my roommate essay would be to lie. Chatting with the other matches, this casual theme seemed to be what everyone who was matched did. I don't think that's a coincidence. I focused on my research for ""Intellectual Vitality"" and how I engaged my project from early one and developed a method for understanding academia and the scientific method. However, I made sure that voice from my roommate carried on in how I felt the first time I had to read an academic paper, e.g.: how I first dreaded reading them, but later started reading them for fun of all things. My QB essays also added depth, but those are a bit too long to break down here; anyone in the QB Facebook group can see my analysis of my extended 800 word essay.
Weaknesses: Community service felt weak post-10th grade. My Math II could have been a higher percentile. Physics experience is very lacking (basic physics, no AP or physics + calc).
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Everyone posting here is competitive, so that's a given. I'd say what distinguished me was QB status as a low-income minority + my essays, LoRs, and extensive research.

I keep reminding myself this decision doesn't define my future success, and how proud I am that I not only will be attending college, but that I have stats high enough to even make an attempt that was only mostly--not entirely--impossible.

Strengths: Generally speaking, everything ""objective"" has been solid and everything ""subjective"" has been half-decent as well (not perfect, but admittedly, half-decent.)
Weaknesses: It's pretty simple. Stanford is looking for a specific kind of person, with the right personality and frame of mind, the right interests, the right ethnicity, etc. Unfortunately, I did not fit into that specific type of person. Grades and awards and clubs aren't going to save that.

General Comments: Personally, I didn't really have the ""world tumbling down"" phenomena as others did. I just thought ""eh,"" and now I'm writing supplements for regular decision. I guess I knew from the beginning that Stanford was a bit too high of a reach. ",Stanford,2020

Essays (rating 1-10, details): 9/10. On my Common App I talked about sports and how they've shaped me into the person I am today. It was pretty good and I worked on it since summer. The roommate one I talked about pokemon. Not kidding. The intellectual vitality I wrote about camp and how I was able to do whatever I had my mind set on and how at the end of the summer I had mastered something I had previously wanted. I think this was kinda lameish and the one I least worked on. What matters to you and why I talked about the impact education has in the poor country I live in and how grateful I am that I can go to school everyday.

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I really don't know. I still have a hard time believing it. It obviously helps that my dad & grandparents went, and that I have a sister there right now, but I think I highlighted the aspects of me that Stanford wants to see in my essays.

General Comments:
Stanford has been my dream school for probably around 10 years now, and I am honored to be given the opportunity to attend. For all those of you applying next year, especially if you don't think you have a chance, just put your heart and soul into your application and let itself work out. Also, a word of advice: DO NOT procrastinate on your essays. If you write them in a day, I promise you they will not be Stanford-worthy essays.

I don't really want to bring this up or consider this, but the kids from my school who've gotten in in the past have always either been low income or Hispanic, and everyone who applied REA this year was white and upper middle/high income. Just observations noted.

Strengths: Definitely my essays, additional information section, recommendations, work experience,

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I really think it was my essays. I took three months to write these essays because I had writer's block for the longest time. I think that my love of English set me apart from a sea of engineering/science majors.

General Comments: Just like many others who were accepted, I honestly was flabbergasted. I fell to the floor and cried for five minutes straight. Congratulations to everyone who was accepted! I hope to meet you all in the future! To those who were deferred, good luck! I really hope every one of you gets in :-) To those who were denied, please don't be too hard on yourselves. There are so many other places in the world to be! You all will do amazingly at other fabulous universities! To future applicants, I have one piece of advice I learned from my English teacher: don't put all your eggs in one basket. Stanford is an amazing place to go, but have some other potential Stanfords on your list as backups. ",Stanford,2020

Teacher Rec #2: 10, from my history teacher. he's been a mentor to me for all of high school and he's an amazing writer. we had a rough start and then became close and developed a sense of respect for each other, so its a different opinion and a good way to see how I relate to teachers.
Counselor Rec: 10 or 9, my graduating class only has 26 kids and she knows me pretty well. I talked with her a lot about applying.
Additional Rec: 10, from my Anatomy & Physiology coach. she's known me for six years and has basically watched me grow into the person I am today. she's also the reason I want to become a doctor and we are very close, she probably knows me better than anyone else I got recommendations from.
Interview: 10, we talked for longer than expected and had a lot in common. she said i was a fit for the university

Essays (rating 1-10, details): 10/10. If I had a ticket into Stanford I knew it would have to be my essays. I am a writer so I pride myself on my writing.I knew this was my one hope. I polished these babies till I shone. I opted for ""funny"" for all of them. I didn't really try to impress rather than entertain, entertain, entertain. So they were all purely joke-based, casual, personable. I think they were taken aback by that, and this is what got me in.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: 8.5/10? My English teacher. She didn't like me at first but by the end of the year I'd say we were tight. Tight enough for me to ask her to write my letter, at least. I also did some extra work for her (helped her plan some classes, performed in a fundraiser she organized, etc.)
Teacher Rec #2: 8.5/10? My French teacher. I've had her for three years. I didn't participate much in her class the last year. Not sure if that made that onto the letter. But she is very nice so I'm sure the letter wasn't very negative. Also, I was homecoming queen and I got her to mention that in the rec letter so maybe that helped me.
Counselor Rec: Maybe 6/10, maybe 9/10. He likes me, but he likes all the kids. I can't tell if he would go out of his way to write me a non-generic one or not.
Additional Rec: 8.5/10 My writing teacher from Iowa Young Writers Studio. She is accomplished (New York Times, Paris Review) and I participated a lot in her class.
Interview: eh. lasted 30 minutes, was kind of awkward. didn't seem to go as well as other peoples' interviews.

General Comments:
thrilled, stunned, and blessed. don't give up! Stanford only accepts 1% of students with GPAs under 3.7. If you play your cards right you can be in that 1% with me.
market yourself smartly. try to find an angle and cast yourself in that angle and drive that point home. If you're good at art (even if you don't identify as purely 'artsy,') drive home the message: i'm artsy. i'm artsy. i'm artsy. that gives the officers almost a ""tag line"" to remember you by, and also it makes you seem like you have a very strong identity.
I tried to market myself as witty and creative. I think that's what got me in.
five other students from my school applied, however, and were rejected. all of them are as or more academically qualified than me, with stellar extracurriculars. just because you don't get in doesn't mean you aren't smart or capable or won't love the college you attend!

Summer Activities: Went to Stanford's Summer Institutes, Princeton's Philosophy Seminar, interned, taught myself some CS, traveled around Europe.
Essays (rating 1-10, details): 10. Seriously. Writing is what I do best, and literally every friend and teacher I talked to thought my essays were absolutely great. My personal statement was incredibly unorthodox, as were my supplemental essays. These certainly had a positive impact on my candidacy.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: English teacher, didn't see. Did great in his class, but he didn't know me personally -- something that I regret in hindsight. Welp, it's just not my style.
Teacher Rec #2: Physics teacher, didn't see. Same blurb as above^
Counselor Rec: Again, didn't see. I got to know him pretty well though, and he saw lots of my writing and knew what made me tick.
Additional Rec: noperoni
Interview: Thought it went great, but then again, I thought I had a chance at getting in (hahaaa). It was scheduled for 45 mins, went 80 mins. She laughed at my jokes, appeared to like me, etc. In the end, I don't think interviews actually matter though.

Reflection
Strengths: Test scores, essays.
Weaknesses: No ""passion"" with ECs, maybe recs?
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Simple -- it's not about academics anymore at these top schools. Literally, there's a bar of achievement you need to cross to not get thrown in the rejection pile right away, then it's all down to your ECs, essays, LOR, and, in some cases, your race and socioeconomic standing. They're not interested in building the best academic community, but the best community (as a Platonic ideal for them -- ethnic diversity, quirky personalities and talents, etc.) filled with kids who happen to be very smart. But it's nowhere near a meritocracy. And, to be honest, I respect that. They saw that, if you took away my scores and essays, I didn't have much to offer. They saw that I didn't have a passion, or something that I was really good at and dedicated to. Point is, if they encounter two applicants -- one with a 2400 and good grades but no clear passion or extraordinary talent and one with a 2250 and good grades with a clear passion and extraordinary talent in that field -- Stanford will take the latter applicant every time. Every time. I heard that many times, and only after seeing the rejection letter did it finally ring true.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Only applied to Stanford so far.
General Comments: Disappointed, but not sad. I mean, I didn't expect to get in, and I'm sure that I'll get in somewhere great. Just kind of mad because after many early decisions have come out and friends have been rejected/denied, I've seen firsthand how much connections and luck come into play. There are complete mongoloids who've gotten into Ivies despite doing no work just because their Dad is a professor at X school, or has donated tons of money -- and that sucks, but you've gotta deal with it. Now I know that this process isn't a true measure of my self-worth. That's liberating in a way, but terrifying too.
Anyways, to prospective applicants: Develop a PASSION. Dance, debate, YouTubing, scientific research -- who cares -- do it with love and care, and do it well. Stanford doesn't just want smart people; they've got more than a healthy pipeline of those applying. In concocting a community, they want somebody who's the BEST at x or y -- not somebody who's a jack of all trades but master of none. If this doesn't sound like you, you'll probably get rejected. But still apply if you're academically qualified; you never know what'll happen. So take that from a rejectee, lol, and good luck. ",Stanford,2020

Reflection:
Strengths: Academics for sure. Even though my SAT score is low, I think the Olympiad experience makes up for it. Participated and won in lots of other science competitions as well.
Weaknesses: Look at ECs. This definitely hurt me. It wasn't that I wasn't interested or was lazy, just that the rigor and timings of my school really killed alot of opportunities that way. Don't regret it though, have learnt a lot along the way.
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: ECs and other outside school stuff. Not a very balanced app.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Not heard from anyone yet.
General Comments:
It's difficult. I don't think I deserved it, especially after only working for US colleges for a year.

Intellectual Vitality: 8/10, I wrote about engagement in my math courses, and related it to other subject areas. It was a little humorous too, which I think helped.
Letter to roommate: 10/10, I had trouble planning it out, but I wrote about running all the time and how that would affect my relationship with my roommate. I think it was well organized, and it was easily the most comedic essay I've ever written.
What matters and why: 6.5/10, I wrote about my strong value of humor, which caused some unintentional irony because the essay itself wasn't that funny.

Teacher Rec #2: not gonna rate this one because i honestly have no idea. from my sophomore/senior year english teacher. i'm assuming its pretty good because she wanted to write my rec for me. i took a lot of risks in her class in terms of writing, but they were worth it, and in the process I found myself as a writer, and she knows all of this.

Essays (rating 1-10, details):
- Common App: Let's just say, the more I read it, the more I cringe... But on the first read many gave me a 8/10.
- Short q's: 7/10, I thought my answers were a bit cliche... I wasn't feeling anything really pop out to me, but I still think I answered to the best of my ability and was really candid with the answers.
- Roommate: 7/10, I talked a lot of about food and Disney... haha. I thought it was a little corny at times, but again I was candid.
- Intellectual vitality: 9/10, I talked about MUN and how although in humanitarian committees (I talked about a committee saving child soldiers) all delegates have a common goal to obvi save child soldiers, we all had different approaches to saving child soldiers. I explained how I thrived from intellectual discourse and the creativity necessary to formulate an effective resolution.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
(Waived my right so I'll just assume)
Teacher Rec #1: 1000000/10. My Japanese teacher and I are VERY VERY CLOSE. She loves me so much that she asked to write a rec for me during my sophomore year. She is not only my teacher, but also my confidant, and someone who I admire and respect very much.
Teacher Rec #2: 9/10. My Gov/Econ teacher. She really liked me and we had intellectual conversations of politics. We bonded over shared political ideologies, but no way was I as close to her as I was with my Japanese teacher. I filled out her questions sheet with passion and honesty, and I hope she was thrilled with my answers.
Counselor Rec: 10/10. Not as close with my counselor because tbh she scares me LOL, but I had a 'mock' interview with her with which she used to write my letter of rec. She praised me throughout the whole interview and really admired my maturation and development as a high school student. I was very candid in the interview as well.
Interview: HHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA. Yeah, the interview didn't go too hot. I think I digressed a lot and repeated a lot of the same statements... I also kind of was called out when I said I wanted to go somewhere far like Stanford because I don't fit in in my upper-class suburban neighborhood. My interview pointed out that Stanford was like that... So i just honestly said that I was bored of where I came from. She understood that because as teenagers we tend to thirst for adventure. Honestly, I wanted to go to Stanford because I want to go to CA, and so I brought that up since I used to live in LA, but then she brought up that the Bay Area was very different from LA... So I really couldn't win...

Weaknesses: SAT, GPA, my comfort with Japanese...
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: There's a rumor that Stanford blacklisted our school. Not even the brightest of the previous classes got accepted. Only one person from our school in 2011 got accepted, and he turned out to be an Olympic-level athlete and a child prodigy.. nbd
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: N/A. Feels good getting my first college decision as a rejection... Looking back, I don't really care about it as much I guess. I really wanted to get in, but I guess the decision was just expected!

Those two were my roommate one about how I am a night person and how that means way more than just staying up late to me and the intellectual vitality one about how I realized during my first semester of high school that, because of the way I learn, I often have to teach myself, simply because I do not learn well from a typical classroom setting.
Teacher Rec #1: English teacher for 2 years (9), liked me a lot because I came in for extra help because English is one of my weaknesses and I improved as a writer because of it
 Teacher Rec #2: Physics teacher for 2 years (6), did well in his class, as well as with the TEAMS competition, which he led; however, I did not have a particularly strong connection with him
 Counselor Rec: I hated her for consistently questioning my courseload as being too hard for me and telling me that USC (a school where the only applicants from my school close to as strong as me got giant scholarships) was a reach for me, but she knew none of this, so I have no idea
Additional Rec: N/A
Interview: Pretty good, idk, I think I'm interesting, but my interviewer might not have
Applied for Financial Aid?: yes, no chance at actually getting any
Intended Major: Engineering

Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): Legacy (Uncle and Grandfather)
Reflection
Strengths: Weighted GPA (esp considering that it was weighed down a ton by my bad freshman year and French performances), Commitment to sports (esp soccer), Test Scores, Competitive Math
Weaknesses: Community Service, Summer Activities, Not Well-Rounded (not sure where this goes), 2 of my 3 recs were probably not all too great, not a good writer so essays might have been bad
Why you think you were rejected: Closest thing to a bum that someone with my grades, etc can be, white and rich, biggest struggle in my life was diabetes which hasn't really been very difficult, not outstanding at any one thing compared to rest of application pool
Where else you are applying or have already applied: UCLA, USC, UC Berkeley, Yale, UCSD, UC Davis, UPenn, Princeton, UVA
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: N/A
General Comments: I didn't expect to get in, as I was well aware that being pretty good at STEM, but not being extraordinarily involved in research or other extracurricular pursuits, while not having any factors in my background that made my education particularly difficult was just not Stanford material. That being said, I had to apply here, even if I had just a slim chance. Also, before coming here, I was pretty fine with my decision, knowing that I am definitely not one of the most qualified candidates applying and only had a decent chance because of my legacy. However, after looking here, I can't help but think that me being rich and white hurt my chance of admission, which annoys me because that isn't something I can control, even if it did help me somewhat. I wrote more, but it makes me come off as classist, which I don't want to do because my issue is more with just not liking college applications and school. Anyhow, I'll get over this and work on my application for the one place that definitely still favors rich, white kids, Princeton. Also, I would like to thank Stanford for getting me into Tyler, the Creator after my rejection. Immaturity and profanity can be more meaningful than you would ever think. ",Stanford,2020

Essays (rating 1-10, details):
Common App- 7/10, talked about my motivations for learning; still don't think it was the strongest
E/C- 8/10, mentoring robotics; nothing special
Intellectual Vitality- 8/10, how I got interested in materials science; a poignant story for me but I don't feel I did a great job communicating it in terms that the adcom could appreciate
Roommate: 11/10, used my fear of cockroaches to portray my different interests and hobbies; probably the best and most creative thing I've ever written
What matters: 10/10, passion for learning; tied together my passions for research and teaching into a cohesive essay
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: AP Stat teacher- 9/10, she and I are really close and she has a track record of getting kids into top schools
Teacher Rec #2: AP Eng teacher- 8/10, I didn't know her as well as my stat teacher but she's very nice
Counselor Rec: 9/10- Talked to her periodically over the course of junior year during which she saw me develop as a person; knows me well
Additional Rec: Professor- 11/10, I've known him for a year and a half and he's been an extremely supportive mentor
Interview: 6/10, lukewarm at best; we met in a Starbucks that happened to be located in a Target (very, very noisy) and he didn't seem convinced that high schoolers could do research....

Roommate: 7, I talked about how my roommate needs to respect my sleep schedule, my organization to save me time and space, and love of sports, playing and watching

I don't know what I am doing wrong. This feels terrible. All those weeks with my body hunched over an SAT and ACT Prep book have gone to waste. Even the endless hours studying for AP and IB exams, balancing sports, guitar, and community service, all seem for nothing. I don't know what Stanford expects from anyone anymore. Good luck to all those who got accepted. For all those rejected, do not worry, we still have a long way ahead of us. ",Stanford,2020

Essays (rating 1-10, details): 9-10 across the board... Not going to lie, they were probably the most difficult and stressful 5 essays that I've ever had the -pleasure- to write but I'm super happy with how they turned out and believe they capture the (better) part of my personality. As an ordinary applicant with no hooks, I think what got me in to Stanford were my very thoughtful essays. Helpful tip: make it easy for the reader to see who you are, emphasizing themes will help more in painting a picture of who you'll be at their college than random points of note. In my overall application, I emphasized the theme of freedom and my own happy-go-lucky attitude towards life.
Personal essay - I want to stress that you don't HAVE to write about your impressive activities here. That was something I worried a lot about but honestly, all you have to do is show your passion in ANYTHING. I explored my past and family life (as an asian immigrant) and connected it to Thoreau's American Dream in his novel Walden as well as a camping experience over the summer. This seems super complex but the topic was so me that my ideas flowed very freely. The hard part was definitely execution (went through at least 10 drafts)... but I leave that to everyone's individual writing process.
Short essays - since my last essay was super serious, I adopted a very light and carefree tone with my supplements. Again, I wanted to show the adcons how I see the world so I went deep and really reflected on my love of music, my passion for science and humanity, and my appreciation for... small acts of kindness. For the letter to a roommate, I drafted a list of the most important aspects of my life/personality and focused on the little things I love, again tying in my overall theme.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): I didn't read any of my rec letters so this is guesswork

General Comments: To all the younger applicants out there: don't let college be your obsession! The first and most important step to getting into a college/selective-hellhole is pursuing your passions: don't worry about what will look good so much as what you like and dislike. Cultivate who you are as an individual and do what you love. Try to stay aware of your goals and be realistic, but don't let the destination keep you from enjoying the journey.
And to current applicants still looking for a place to be next year: remember to stay true to who you are! Don't think your future depends upon one institution. After all, college is only one path of many to a much longer road beyond... so keep going and I know you'll all be somewhere amazing next year! Good Luck! ",Stanford,2020

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Honestly it was a long shot, considering I live in the Bay Area. Stanford is notorious for rejecting even the most qualified students in this area, and I know a bunch of other people much ""better"" candidates than I am rejected. I am a little sad, but it's nice to just get the weight off of my shoulders.
Also, I found out that I had to turn in my CommonApp early by like a month because I was submitting a portfolio, and this news hit me like a week before my due date. Even though I started my essays early (don't procrastinate, kids), it was still a whirlwind.
General Comments:
To get a little personal here, I do regret applying REA just because it didn't let me apply to another school I definitely would have applied early to if it weren't in the East Coast. I think I was just totally blindsided because I live so near Stanford (like 20 minutes) and have a bunch of merch from when my dad went. So check yo'self before you wreck yo'self. ",Stanford,2020

I truly wrote from the heart for the first time ever probably. My other essay was about growing up poor, sleeping inside of a closet for a year like Harry Potter, but not because my family hated me, my ""bed"" (it was legit made out of ply-wood by my dad) just didn't fit anywhere else in our tiny trailer. I did actually include that bit about Harry Potter to open and close off the essay, I thought it was fun.

Extracurriculars (place leadership in parenthesis): NHS (treasurer), Science Honor Society (VP), Debate (Prez), Rho Kappa, Mu Alpha Theta, swim (quit sophomore year due to injury), research internship from summer before senior year to end of March at a university, UIL Social Studies and Spelling.
Job/Work Experience: Tutored Pre-AP Physics, Algebra II, Calc AB, and Pre-AP Bio
Volunteer/Community service: Volunteered as clerical assistant at a doctor's office, tutor/mentor for an organization at a middle school, food pantry, Special Olympics swim coach, online work for two debate charities
Summer Activities: swimming and debate camp for summer before freshman and sophomore year, coding camp (really all I learned was that coding is not for me), debate camp and Stanford HEAT Institute summer before junior, research internship, work for debate charities, and Special Olympics coaching summer before senior. For the app I mentioned that I also learned how to drive summer before senior year, probably did not affect admission
Essays (rating 1-10, details):
Common app: 9/10 wrote about research which felt pretty generic but I put it in a creative format and made it more about how the project forced me to grow up than the content of the project itself
Room mate: 9/10 finished this hours before the deadline, basically filled it with facts about myself based on an ordinary day with me. Had a clever-ish hook about social media. I would've originally scored this lower but my admissions counselor wrote in her letter to me that she liked it so I guess it was better than I thought.
Intellectual vitality: 10/10 one of the best essays I've ever written, was about confronting privilege and why I (mostly) quit debate. felt sort of ballsy because it was about quitting a major extracurricular but I thought it turned out well
What matters to you: 7/10 despite many warnings to explicitly not do this, I wrote about religion (I'm Buddhist). used Buddhism to explain some facets of my character. Didn't love it but it was okay.
Short answers: 9/10 Probably didn't affect admission but I had a lot of fun with these.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: 10/10, read it for a later scholarship, was so good it made me cry. Teachers rock.
Teacher Rec #2: 9/10, equally as good as first in terms of content but slightly less eloquent.
Counselor Rec: 10/10 presumably, have been close with my counselor for years, and I don't think the counselor rec usually consists of much beyond ""she was a good student and she didn't commit any felonies""
Additional Rec: 10/10, doctor at the doctor's office I volunteered at, she liked me a lot and her writing was excellent
Interview: Didn't get one although others from my school did

Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): I don't think Viet counts as URM, sister attended Stanford for undergrad and uncle attended for grad
Reflection
Strengths: Essays, teacher recs, community service, unsure whether to say test scores/grades bc I feel like many who get rejected have better scores/grades than I did
Weaknesses: Lack of major scientific awards to show for the amount of research I did, less extracurriculars than many/not well rounded in extracurriculars
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: lots of luck. I felt like essays were my strongest point, but the more I think about it I suspect my quasi-legacy through my sister and uncle probably helped.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Accepted to UT but rejected from UT honors , waiting to hear from Harvard.
General Comments: For someone with my socioeconomic position I didn't feel like I achieved way more than I was expected to, and I'm still in shock at my acceptance. When I was doing applications and lurking on all the 2020 applicant threads I felt sure that my single-minded extracurriculars and lack of any major scientific award would screw me over, but it didn't. Assuming I wasn't solely a legacy admit, what I learned from this is that it's okay to only pursue activities that you really care about rather than do a slew of ECs that mean nothing to you. I probably could've stacked my ECs more but there's no way I would've been as successful in debate and research if I did; heck I straight up quit piano and swim once I got more into debate because I wanted to spend all my time in debate and nowhere else. For those of you who really hate a lot of the ECs you're doing and want to quit and focus on one thing, I encourage you to do so if that's truly what you're most passionate about. Good luck to those of you waiting to hear from RD! ",Stanford,2020

Accepted: at all UC's applied to
Waitlisted: none
Rejected: none
General Comments: He had the whole package but even with that- it's a long shot! We were prepared to be disappointed but thrilled when he was accepted. He knows that he would have gotten in somewhere else great if it hadn't been Stanford. Outside of the fact that you need strong grades, test scores, letters of rec etc... one of things that I think they take a very hard look at are the essays. He started in August once the Common App was out before he was busy with school- he had the rough drafts done by the time school started, had 2 different (very experienced) college counselors, along with another teacher, read his essays and he honed them over Sept and Oct. He submitted his app a few days before the deadline. Give yourself plenty of time, proof read everything- essays as well as other Common App sections and then hope for the best. It's crazy stressful but it really does all work out! Best of Luck! ",Stanford,2020

Intellectual Vitality (10): about playing Legend of Zelda games and connecting it to logic puzzles as well as the mathematics regarding nonlinearity of plot and dungeon structure.

What matters (8): Nosce te ipsum - know thyself
Short answers (9): I wanted to witness the possibility of Fermat actually proving Fermat's Last Theorem. Maybe he scribbled it on a napkin somewhere or talked about it to a friend? The other answers were silly/fun but honest.

Summer Activities: touring, playing at Lollapalooza, being studious in summer classes, tutoring people, preseason for Cross Country.
Essays (rating 1-10, details): TERRIBLE. My essays were terrible. I'm convinced they didn't read them. For instance--I swear this is true--I answered the question about my favorite websites with ""stanford.edu."" Not making this up. (I guess I planned to change it later and just forgot.) The one thing is, since I clearly forgot to edit, my ""true self"" really shined through.

Roommate essay: 8/10, about how I promise to use headphones when playing my Korg at 1:34 AM and plan to rope her into 5-mile runs.

Essays (rating 1-10, details):
Common App: I would say is a 9/10 since it was laboriously edited and I really spoke from the heart. I feel like the essay spoke to itself and it came together the way I wanted it to. Talked about my life through literature and my journey in realizing my passions
Intellectual Vitality: 10/10 I talked about the Three Systems of Oppression (Patriarchy, White Supremacy, and Capitalism) and how that opened my mind up. I talked about how I learned so much about myself and other people. I talked about the intellectual and emotional journey I went through after I discovered this. This is what I was trained to talk about and I feel a lot towards this subject.
Roommate Essay: 9/10 I LOVED my letter to my future roommate. I really expressed my personality in this one and I was genuine about everything I said. It was well-written and empathetic, I think. I'm giving it a 9 because the last line sounds a little contrived to me now.
What Matters Essay: 10/10 This is the best thing I wrote for the College Application process. I wrote about how Stories are what matters most to me, how they are essential to humanity, how they can reach across societal boundaries, how they are necessary for living etc. I actually got emotional writing this one at the time and felt the same surge of emotion reading it, so I definitely meant every word to my core.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: 8/10 My US History teacher who really understands my moral codes, my thoughts on history, my thoughts on social issues etc. He has a very good picture of me. I rated it an 8 only because I feel like it wasn't as heartfelt? as I feel a good rec should be. He definitely meant it, though.
Teacher Rec #2: 10/10 My Anatomy and Physiology AND Psychology teacher who knows me so well and is so invested in my happiness and always talks about how glad she is she knows me. The teacher I am closest to in high school. I know she gave me an amazing rec, I can feel it.
Counselor Rec: No idea, I don't talk to my counselor very often, but I feel like she probably wrote a 7/10 at the least.

Reflection
Strengths: DEFINITELY my essays; I was so so so happy with them, I wouldn't change a word. My recs were definitely strong as well. I think my dedication to the LGBTQ community showed in my application. Also my essays tied in really really well with my major and career goals.
Weaknesses: Definitely my SAT score and I am a late bloomer when it comes to Extracurriculars. I didn't find my niche until junior year.
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: ESSAYS AND RECS. I didn't censor myself at all and really poured myself into my application. I actually mentioned FANFICTION of all things FIVE TIMES in my writings and revealed that I consume it at a rate of 100K a day. NO joke. I was super honest about myself and who I was and where I was at this point of my life as a person. I did all of this in my essays. Also, I am graduating from high school with my AA degree in Arts and Humanities (63 college credits), and being IGETC-certified. I busted my butt to catch up and do this in time to graduate.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I was accepted to UCLA, UCSB, UC Berkeley, UCSC, Williams College, Swarthmore College, CSU Fullerton, CSU Long Beach, CSU Northridge, Boston University, Vassar College, Carleton College. I was waitlisted for Bowdoin College and Wesleyan University. I was rejected by University of Chicago and Northwestern University. I am still waiting on Yale, Haverford College, USC, and UPenn.
General Comments: SO SO SO EXCITED TO HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED!!!! I AM SO PUMPED. I am so grateful for how hard I worked on those essays I am positive that is what ultimately got me accepted :DD ",Stanford,2019

Job/Work Experience: N/A
Volunteer/Community service: Volunteered at local Red Cross chapter since 8th Grade, also through on campus clubs
Summer Activities: Went to several camps. Had this awesome Economics camp my senior year which I wrote about in my essays.
Essays (rating 1-10, details): Common App Essay (7/10): It was about me finding myself through failure. I think it was solid but there was nothing special about it. What Matters (8/10): Wrote about my grandpa, his illness, and his role in my life. Topic was kind of cliche I guess but I thought I had an interesting take on it. Intellectual Vitality (9/10): It was really solid. Roommate Letter (8/10): I think I took a kind of bold spin on mine instead of going for the usual ""this is me"" spin. It was a bit philosophical but I figured it was bold (and I needed bold). Short Answers (9/10): I think my answers were really well thought out and unique.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: 10. I've known my English teacher since before 9th grade when I first made newspaper in middle school. I've had him for newspaper three years and both AP English Language and Literature, and he's also my club adviser. He's basically like my second father; we've had a lot of one-on-one talks after school and lunch starting my sophomore year; he was the one that encouraged me to apply to reach schools like Stanford actually when I figured I'd be content with Cal or USC. He said my writing was among the best he's seen in his career and he told me to email him my essays during the summer and gave me a lot of feedback. I am so, so glad to have a mentor like him.
Teacher Rec #2: 8. I struggled a lot in Honors Precalculus/Calculus A, and it was actually one of the only two B's I received in all of high school prior to senior year. But my Precalc teacher knows how came in at lunch and would ask for help a lot, and though I struggled early on junior year, I improved and got an A second semester.
Counselor Rec: 6. I go to a large public school with 3500+ students, and I didn't even get my normal counselor lol. They assigned some temp counselor that probably wrote a generic form letter for all of my privates.

State (if domestic applicant): CA
Country (if international applicant): N/A
School Type: Large Public (3500+ Students)
Ethnicity: Asian
Gender: M
Income Bracket: Don't want to be too specific. Enough to qualify for financial aid at Stanford but not enough for federal grants.
Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): Not really.
Reflection
Strengths: I had great stats, especially for science and mathematics. Looking back at it, I should have applied myself more in those subjects (although I'm dying in physics right now) and tried out for those academic teams. I also think my essay writing was really solid, although Stanford wasn't my best app.
Weaknesses: Extracurriculars come to mind. Considering my background, I don't have anything that stands out. I definitely had the numbers to get into a place like Stanford but I know that there was more I could have done. I don't really regret not doing more because I have a lot of great memories from what I did instead, but at the same time, I understand there was a consequence for the choices I made.
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I just failed to stand out from the application pool. I believe that I was qualified, but I think the same can be said for almost everyone else that applied to Stanford. Looking at this thread, everyone here is so phenomenal and there just isn't enough space for every single one of us.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected:
Accepted - Cal, UCLA, UCSD, UC Irvine, Fordham, Washington
Waitlisted - Caltech
Deferred - Princeton SCEA
Rejected - Stanford, MIT, Northwestern, USC
Most likely going to Cal but waiting on some Ivies. Going out with a bang.
General Comments: It would have been nice to have, but I always knew that it was a long shot. I'm glad that I'm in a situation where I still have some really great options (Cal and UCLA) to go to next year, and that I still have hope considering the process is not yet done for me. Looking back on it, I'm glad that I applied to Stanford, even though I didn't get in. I learned a lot about myself from writing the essays and going through the next experience. To those of you reading this next year, if there's one thing you get out of this it's this: don't be afraid to try. I know it's said you miss all the shots you don't take, and I believe that's true. I'll never have the benefit of the doubt on this decision, and I know this rejection doesn't take anything away from my accomplishments. I didn't quite achieve my dreams, but I'm still proud of what I accomplished. I'm going to be a Bear next year most likely, and I'm going to enjoy watching The Game. Good luck to all of you on the waitlist and those of you applying next year! ",Stanford,2019

Stanford Supplement: It was decent. Threw it together quickly, but I liked the message that came through and felt like it gave at least a decent image of me as a person.
Teacher Recommendations: Journalism teacher and history/government teacher. Both had me for three years and moderated the activities in which I participate, should have been great. I'll never know.

General Comments/Advice/Hindsight: To be 100% honest, this makes my life much easier. This was the one school that would make me doubt going to Oxford — because Yale, Harvard, and UChicago are all, to varying degrees, based on Oxford and I like the original version—and getting rejected just means I can be totally sure in my choice. Also, now I get to say I attended the President and Fellows of the College of St. Mary Magdalen at the University of Oxford, wh.

Summer Activities: Tutoring
Essays (rating 1-10, details): My short questions all maxed out the word limits. There were actually some errors, but it was all very honest, so I'd give them a solid 9. A nice mix of sophisticated and quirky. For example, my favorite artists were Bosch, Duchamp, Klimt, Van Gogh, Mike Borja (my uncle lol), Frida Kahlo, Childish Gambino, and Bjork. I said that apathy was the most significant challenge today, and I talked about Netflix and wisdom teeth surgery when answering the question about my summer. I would also give my short essays a solid 9, because they were personal and different from what I think a lot of other people might have said. I talked about my success with spelling bees as a kid and how that led to an infatuation with linguistics for the intellectual vitality one. For the letter to my roommate, I wrote about how I like to build forts and work late in to the night, as well as how much I love to play video games. My final essay was about addressing injustice. Again, I truly felt that all of these were incredibly strong. As you could tell from my previous stats, writing and english are my strong suits.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: 10. My APUSH, Psych, and Gov teacher who has worked with me in the classroom and in extracurriculars. It was like 5 pages long and beautifully written. Best recommendation that I could ask for, very comprehensive.
Teacher Rec #2: 9. From my English teacher (both for pre-AP as a freshman and AP as a senior) who also happened to be my AP Art History Teacher. Much more compact than my other one, but focused more on who I was as a student of the humanities, which really helped for my applied focuses of English, Education, or Linguistics.
Counselor Rec: 8. I honestly never got to read this one, but she was very fond of me and was always impressed with my accomplishments and invested in my success. I'm guessing that it was pretty good.
Additional Rec: I submitted a peer recommendation late, so I'm not sure if it was actually considered. But it was pretty good. It was from an upperclassman who had graduated last year. I had replaced him as president in many of our extracurriculars, and he was a dear friend who was able to speak candidly about my character and my leadership abilities.

General Comments: On a side note, I attended the Stanford Pre-Collegiate Summer Institutes for Expository Writing this last summer, so it was beneficial for me to get a feel for the campus culture. I feel very lucky that Stanford's unconventional application worked well for me, but I would advise anyone looking to apply in the future to be very honest about their answers. I saw on Stanford's website that this year was the biggest applicant pool in the history of the school, so I can only imagine how competitive it was!

Teacher Rec #1: 7.5/10. Written by both the TA and the professor of my pre-calc II class at the university; I got the highest score on the final exam out of a class of a few hundred college kids, so I hoped the letter would help make up for my crap SAT math score. Probably pretty generic though.

Reflection
I was definitely not expecting much from Stanford. I knew there were much more qualified students out there who would probably overshadow me and that's okay! I took the shot and I don't regret it at all! Actually, If I didn't put my heart and soul into my Stanford essays, I probably wouldn't have been so inspired to write such amazing essays that got me into some of the best universities in the nation! I'm pretty happy with how everything has turned out and I'm definitely grateful for all the opportunities - so not feeling bummed or heartbroken. Good luck to all future applicants and Congratulations to those who were accepted!

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: California has the biggest and most competitive academic decathlon program in the nation.

Some were just about my extracurriculars, but most were about who I am as a person. The prompts really allow you to open up, and I thoroughly enjoyed writing these essays.

Why you think you were waitlisted: I think I had great extracurriculars, but I didn't really take challenging classes, and because of that I didn't take any SAT Subject Tests either. Also I mean it's Stanford so...
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Accepted: Duke, UNC-Chapel Hill, and Georgia Tech. Rejected: UC Berkeley.
General Comments: I'm actually happy I even got on the waitlist. Years ago, I never thought I'd even be applying to a school like Stanford. There are so many people who are much academically stronger than I am who got rejected. Even though they rarely take anyone off the waitlist, I'm just happy I made it this far, and that they actually cared about my application. Congrats to all those who got in. I'm sure we'll all do well no matter where we go.
To future applicants: Don't stress so much over every test and taking every AP class. Yes, they'll help you get into college and if you enjoy them, that's great, but if you spend time doing things that make you smile, things that you really care about, you'll enjoy high school so much more. In my opinion (although I'm sure not everyone agrees with me), that is so much more important than an acceptance letter. A name like Stanford will definitely help you, but it doesn't mean you can't find your own success elsewhere. ",Stanford,2019

Strengths: I think my strengths are that I am a URM, and I am very passionate about advocacy work that not many high school kids are involved in.
Weaknesses: I indicated that I was interested in a science major, and I don't have the original research/impressive scientific course-load that many have (aside from AP Environmental, AP Chem, AP Physics 1, and Biochem/Biophysics at Yale Summer Session).
General Comments/Advice/Hindsight: Don't do something simply because people say ""colleges like to see it"". Find something you are passionate about, and commit yourself to it. Chances are, you will end up doing some pretty awesome things because your passion will naturally lead you to pursue opportunities. Plus, you will be happy and enthusiastic as well. ",Stanford,2019

This is my 2 cents... don't try to force what you think Stanford wants (quirky) just write about what you really love! I even wrote about Porsche winning LeMans. Although it's cliche I can't help but stress that you need to be yourself. And, if the adcons like who you are, than awesome! If they don't, than you might not be the perfect fit that they are looking for. Long 2 cents, but in summary: don't force a perfect application, no one's perfect! GOOD LUCK class of 2020!!
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: (10) I always went in after class to talk to this said teacher regarding project ideas I had. We got pretty close, to where we could joke around and it was obvious in class he liked me.
Teacher Rec #2: (8) I think that this said teacher wrote me a good rec. But, I have no real way to tell. We really weren't that close.
Counselor Rec: (10) I've gotten really close to my councilor over the years, so I have good reason to believe that this Rec was really good.
Additional Rec: I sent in two additional rec letters by snail mail. I don't think that Stanford really wants additional info, but I truly believed the two letters gave the adcon a deeper understanding of me.

Reflection: I would never had though I would get into Stanford!! But, I am so excited to have. For the class of 2020 here are some tips that I felt helped me through the application process: Read your essays over and over. Don't be afraid if you think an essay is bad to completely throw it out and start anew (I did this a couple of times). Please don't write about anything cliche- you can find cliche topics easily with Google (AVOID THESE).

Intellectual Vitality Essay: About how I realized that inspiration doesn't need to come from intellectual sources, that even something as simple as a balance beam can inspire me. 8/10
Letter to Roommate: Rewrote and rewrote this one. I apologized for a conversation that I said we were going to have in which I was fascinated with a stupidly obscure topic and I neglected my duties as a roommate. It sounds bad, but I thought it was very funny, and multiple other people read it and they all liked it. 9/10
What matters to you and why?: Probably my best essay of this admissions season. Talked about how being adventurous was important to me, and how going to someplace faraway like Stanford was the adventure that I craved. It included my favorite line of all my college essays: ""I love the sound of planes flying overhead. It reminds me that we are not stuck anywhere in this world.""

General Comments:
Not going to lie, this one really upset me. Can't say I didn't see it coming, but Stanford's been the dream for like two years now. I threw my all into this app, I even delayed sending for REA to make sure it was perfect, and I came up short. I don't think there was anything more I could have done. We'll see, maybe I'll send out a transfer app for kicks, but I'll probably try again for grad school. You can't get rid of me that easily, Stanford.  ",Stanford,2019

General Comments: Seriously still in so much shock/awe that I got in-- definitely hasn't fully sunk in yet, and probably won't until move-in day in September. On the admit packet, there was a quote about learning things for the sake of learning them, not because it would be on the test; I think my high school experience was basically that, and it really reflected in a lot of my essays, so maybe that's why they liked me? What scares me though is that I almost didn't apply-- on the day the app was due, I had one more essay to write and was generally super not down to do it, so I almost quit altogether (so thanks Mom for yelling at me for 2 hours after I told you I wanted to not apply to Stanford haha)... and then I was going over my app and realized I almost submitted 2 of the same essay whoops...

General Comments: I filled this out for my son, who preferred not to have all details posted, including a fifth top-tier private school he was accepted to. My advice: Be yourself; follow your ""passion"" (if you have one—if not, don't fake it); take the most rigorous course load you can; get top grades; do well on the SAT and/or ACT (aim for 2250+ on former and 35+ on latter, but no matter what, don't take either one more than twice!); enter local, state, national, and international competitions and hope to place in some; don't worry if you're not an athlete; don't get your heart set on one or two schools—keep in mind that you can be happy and successful anywhere. My son had several other less-than-top-tier schools he was very interested in and would have been happy to attend—and, because of his EC, we (his parents) actually wondered whether he should put off college or even skip it altogether. But he really wanted to go, and we think he'll get a lot out of it (though it will slow down his EC career, as high school did). Please don't private message me asking for further details about his EC, since he would prefer to keep that information confidential. Good luck, everyone—even with his outcome, we found this process very stressful and difficult, right up to and including making the final decision about which school to attend. The good news is, no matter where you end up, you'll be happy the college admissions process is over! ",Stanford,2019

Essays (rating 1-10, details):
Favorite Books, etc: 7 or 8/10. Kept it simple.
What I enjoy: 6-7/10, once again simple and honest. Math based (numberphile, youtube watching)
Significant Challenge: 8/10, talked about how the infinite potential of nuclear development and the desire for power can cause disaster, and how science today is contributing primarily to developing weapons of mass destruction.
Spending summers: 6/10, made short points about various activities (internship, vacations, running, origami, music)
Favorite Events: 7/10
Historical Moment:8/10
Intellectual Vitality essay: 8.5/10. Talked about how one of my teachers can do a certain odd math trick and how that intrigued me. Used it as a basis to convey my passion for math.
Letter to Roomate: 10/10. Used different scientific and mathematical principles to describe myself and my anticipated future activities at Stanford.
What Matters to You and Why: I'm not entirely sure how this essay was received. It's probably what turned off admissions. I wrote about how my parents wanted me to be a doctor, but I decided to be an engineer. Then I talked about individuality and why it matters to me. I thought it was like a 7/10 when I submitted it, but looking back its more like a 6/10.

Reflection: Honestly, Stanford is a very selective school and I was down to have not gotten in, but later I realized it may have not been the best fit for me. I got into Cornell and plan to go there, so I'm excited and was able to get over my rejection. Applying to Stanford was a great experience.
Strengths: Good SAT, academics, some essays were good.
Weaknesses: Awkward ""what matters to you essay"", maybe didn't have enough international competition awards (still have no idea how people get those)
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: It's very competitive and can be arbitrary at times. Many people who assume they won't get in will get in, and many who think they have a good chance end up getting rejected. It's a part of the process lol.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected:
Accepted: GIT, RPI, RIT, Cornell
Waitlisted, later rejected: MIT, Caltech, Carnegie Mellon. Waitlisted UPenn but didn't accept waitlist.

- Transcriber for prison reform radio program: I transcribe and proofread handwritten letters from federal and state prisoners to the organization.
- Peace Corps Campus Ambassador: Recruited as only high schooler in nationwide Peace Corps Ambassador program. Helped organize recruitment, outreach strategies, worked to promote Peace Corps at school with regional recruiter. I strongly encourage other applicants to apply as a high schooler--NOT for college, but because Peace Corps is just a gorgeous organization, and there should be more awareness at the high school level. The job is meant for universities, so my case was a little unusual, but hey--apply anyways! That’s what I did, and it’s been very enlightening so far.

I don’t think I can give an accurate “rating” for my essays. I tried my best--I wrote at my best.
Personal statement: About working as a transcriber for a radio program even though volunteers had to be “18 years and older.” Showed how I hate staying within my comfort zone and how I challenged my traditional beliefs about prisoners. Talked about importance of empathy and my passion for prison reform.
Extracurricular: Talked about my organization, upcoming campaigns we’re planning, and how we may not be a huge organization, but I’m proud of what we’ve accomplished.
Roommate: Extremely weird, like me. Talked about how I’m like, what to watch out for, and History Channel. And sleep-deprived bears during hibernation season. The normal stuff.
Intellectual vitality: Talked about how traveling the world with my mom and little brother has shaped my entire mindset on life and my goals for the future. I’ve traveled to 24 countries and 15 states. I’m happiest when I’m away from home.
What matters to you and why: Talked about tolerance. Slut-shaming, racial prejudice, and my own family: where an atheist, a Buddhist, a Presbyterian, and a few agnostics eat and laugh together at one dinner table. Tolerance is at the very foundation of my morals, so I thought it was important to mention.Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: From Activities Director at school/in charge of Student Council and Mock Trial. I’ve known him since freshman year. He thinks I’m “shy” though, so idk how accurate the rec was…

Essays (rating 1-10, details):
Common App Essay: 9. showed this one to all of my teachers. It was about public speaking and thoughts just before I go up and speak competitively. This was the ""Describe a place where you are perfectly content"" one.
Describe an important intellectual development: 8. I talked about learning that I wasn't right all the time (I was kind of a **** as a toddler, and how it's important for everyone to realize that they can't be the best at everything.
Roommate Essay: 5. The most cliche essay. Talked about things I liked, and made jokes about Stanford and going there.
What matters to you Essay: 9. This was my most favorite one to write. Discussed the importance of listening to others, and I imagined what it would be like if we listened to other people more.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
I waived my right to see all of my recommendations, so I'm just guessing here.
Teacher Rec #1: My AP Bio teacher. 7, we got along well, and had a fair amount of banter. Wouldn't have chosen her if schools didn't like to see recommenders in your intended subject area.
Teacher Rec #2: My AP Psych/Euro teacher. 8, we get along great. Really fun teacher, and a good writer.
Counselor Rec: 6. I probably know her the least, though she at least recognizes who I am, and remembers what I do.
Additional Rec: 9. My MUN coach/sponsor. She knows me the best, and we're good friends. Great writer, and probably wrote something good.
Interview: 10. Went 30 minutes over time, and lasted for an hour and a half in all. The important thing here (and as advice) was showing that I wasn't some boring textbook applicant. Talked a lot, and joked around. I was lucky that my interviewer was really fun/was laid back.

Reflection
Strengths: Talking a lot, and being passionate about the kinds of things that I do.
Weaknesses: No sports, some weakness in my Math SAT relative to the Stanford average. A lot of other kids at my school who applied had better extracurriculars, I think.
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Definitely well-roundedness. I had a little bit of everything in my application.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Accepted with a scholarship to Pitt, though I likely won't apply anywhere else if Stanford gives me enough money.
General Comments: You really have to shine out in your application. Don't spend time trying to tailor your application to the school; your school knows you're a load of BS. Similarly, don't try to be one of those stereotypical hyperactive applicants who go crazy on certain things. Really, be yourself, and sell yourself to the school. Show that you're not some random kid who's one of the thousands of other applicants, show them that you're a unique individual who DESERVES to go to the school you're applying to. Be active about getting in, and be very passionate. You don't have to be one of those kids submitting massive research experience, or who volunteered in saving kids in Guatemala. Take advantage of ALL the opportunities that are given to you, and always ask more questions.
If nothing else, best of luck to you on all of your applications, and to quote the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy:

Not really that bummed about it. Kinda expected it. It is Stanford. At the end of the day we're up against the world in these applications and being exceptional isn't good enough. You gotta be Exceptional amongst the world class exceptional. ",Stanford,2019

Why you think you were accepted: Honestly I just followed my passion. That sounds really cliche and I know you've all heard it before, but almost all of my accomplishments came from me just doing things because I felt like it. I didn't even decide to apply to Stanford until I started senior year. I was aiming for UCLA all throughout high school, so I didn't overburden myself with classes and clubs... I don't think I even really joined a club haha. Just do what you love, don't force yourself to do things just to get into school.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Applied to the UC system, NYU, Barnard, Columbia... waiting to hear back

Weaknesses: Light number of AP classes( compared to my peers - I attend a very competitive high school), light senior year schedule, few Subject Tests, less experience in leadership, few activities unrelated to music
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: All of the strengths listed above, but it all came down to the essays. The essays are so important, I cannot emphasize this enough. When writing, I tried to tell a story, illustrate a scene so my audience could visualize everything and feel something in their hearts. What was important was to write something from my heart and something that would leave a lasting impression on an audience that was reviewing thousands of applications.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Accepted at Indiana University at Bloomington
General Comments: I am incredibly grateful, honored, and humbled that Stanford selected me to be part of their Class of 2019. I realize that others may have to wait several more months to receive their decisions, and others still may have been already rejected. To all of those students, I offer you my best wishes and support as you continue applying for colleges. I believe that we will receive answers to all of our questions in time, so just keep having faith that everything will be all right, and keep persevering and never lose sight of what's most important to you. To those who have been accepted to Stanford, congratulations. I look forward to meeting you next year! ",Stanford,2019

Intellectual Vitality (10) - I wrote about how I founded my non-profit and how I have benefited from working with students around the world

What Matters to You (10) - I wrote about 9/11 and how it has become a shadow on our generation. I have a very vivid memory of that day and have followed its repercussions over the years. It also inspired me to want to work in international affairs.

Teacher Rec #2: (10) - my APUSH teacher. We also got along really well, and he was really excited when I asked him to write the letter. The AP score probably helped here too.
Counselor Rec: (10) - My counselor left the school at the end of summer, so I got a new one at the beginning of the year. I made a really good first impression with her, and she has become my biggest cheerleader. Making friends with your counselor is so important!

Strengths: My grades, AP tests, I thought essays were good overall
Weaknesses: Maybe the essays were too cliché? I can’t really blame myself if this were the case because I do believe that they represent myself.
Why you think you were rejected: Lack of very good extracurriculars – although I have leadership positions and am very involved in my rather few activities, I seem to lack the things that make me STAND OUT. No Intel, no Siemens or any of the sort. Red Cross is a relatively new club but I can’t say I founded it because it’s in its 2nd year. No one needs to win big things like Intel or even go but I believe that in my case it just made me a mediocre candidate.
Where else were you accepted: University of Texas-Austin
General Comments: Congratulations to everyone I got in! For those rejected, I understand how you’re feeling.  However don’t be discouraged! There are other colleges out there that will accept you! Good luck to everyone! ",Stanford,2019

Job/Work Experience: Nil, heh
Volunteer/Community service: Working with kids with intellectual disability grades 10-12
Summer Activities: School trip to Bhutan, annual camp for intellectually disabled people organising team with working adults, walking around with history geek friends looking for random monuments... ah well
Essays (rating 1-10, details):
Commonapp: 7-8/10 my family's (we're technically mainland Chinese) immigrant background and how it influenced me to try to reach out to migrant workers - I went for metaphorical and personal but felt it could have sounded contrived.
Roommate: 8-9/10 about my love for ducks and what my roommate's choice of animal would be, poked fun at the duck syndrome.
What matters: 9/10 to have a sense of wonder, both academically and in encountering other people? Tried to link this to how I try to listen to other people and see their inner world in my community/advocacy stuff. Alluded to Vermeer my fav painter heh
Intellectual vitality: about how I was confused by the need to extrapolate based on lack of factual info relating to a Cold War question in history, and ended up reconciling uncertainty through reading about Bayes probability. Dad the math expert is quite sure the theory wasn't entirely sound, but basically I tried to show my curious obsessive side. : >
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): Teacher Rec #1: 7-8/10? Economics teacher who liked me and was a generally very trusted/able rec writer with colleges, but he thought I was wincingly shy (he told a friend as a joke that I always ""looked like he was going to slap me"" when I spoke up in class, so uh)
Teacher Rec #2: 9/10 awesome lit teacher went to all our club-organised events, supervised my coursework and was basically hugely supportive and tried to see the best in every student - and undoubtedly tried her best in all her recs.
Counselor Rec: 8/10 in Singapore our Civics Tutors (homeroom teachers?) write this, mine was a lit teacher who probably got to know us somewhat better re. personality, extracurriculars than the average guidance counselor. Idk if this helps you guys, but our teacher got our class to write little mini writeups about each other from a friend's perspective, highlighting personal incidents that demonstrate character traits more intimately as material for her rec. Figured a lot of public school kids in the US might benefit from trying out the same thing informally to avoid more generic recs?
Interview: OK, he was an CS/Econ major and I was talking about my love for lit - I will say that I tried my best to get my interviewer's ""vibe"" and anchored my more idealistic social justice-y inclinations to a more pragmatic, real world perspective as far as I could? He was warm and tolerant of juvenile slang, I'm sure they all are!

Applied for Financial Aid?: No

Ethnicity: Chinese
Gender: F
Income Bracket: ~$100,000? Can't remember if I listed, though
Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): Asian applicant who's into humanz and writing, i.e. somewhat against the Stanford stereotype though I'm not sure how far it's true?
Reflections
Strengths: ""hooks"", and possibly the more litsy style of my essays because I'm not sure how much attention the comm gives to arts supplements so I suppose this was a more direct/ unavoidable way to display my major artistic EC?
Weaknesses: extracurriculars, the fact that I'm not the most confident and can be hopelessly shy/nervous with authority figures heh, which my teachers may have remarked on.
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: my hook of sorts, and the effort I put into my essays - I'm sure the approach I went for isn't the only one that works, but basically I tried to think about what I stood for personally and related that to what I did consistently, while trying to ensure that each part of my personality (geeky, irreverent, idealistic) showed
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Nil
General Comments: I know you're probably just skipping to the stats heh but I followed CC for years as a lurker and never thought I had a chance, but imo admissions stuff depends on [other than luck] displaying a distinct view of the world from your own perspective and relating it to the things you do, which is something that comes naturally with time and maturity. So please don't freak out, and don't take anything as gospel. You lot on the Stanford REA applicants thread are the nicest I've seen around and quite frankly intimidated me with your obv passions/ talents and good-with-peopleness.

Performances in several productions & participation in intensives at some amazing national studios. My main extracurricular), production intern with local radio station (3 yrs), neurology shadow (2 yrs), VP of state Latin organization
Job/Work Experience: Tutor (math & reading, with a company -- almost 2 years)
Volunteer/Community service: Camp counselor (1 yr only), SSAT tutor for underprivileged children with organization (3 yrs)
Summer Activities: academic summer programs at universities, work, shadowing neurologist, camp counselor, ballet intensive, etc. Not very cohesive
Essays (rating 1-10, details): Common App (9 -- I was really proud of this one. Talked about ballet from a failure aspect/redefining success), Extracurricular (7 -- nice, uplifting, and pretty, but doesn't tie in too much with the rest of my app or life in general, as it discussed the kid I worked with at a disability summer camp), Short Answers (7 -- honest, varied, but nothing standout here. Tied in ballet and neuroscience, two big passions, though), Intellectual Vitality (6 -- talked about how my love for neuroscience started in the home but grew into an animal of its own. I liked it a lot when I submitted it, but to be fair, it's cliche), Future Roommate (7 -- the mix of big city/small town feels in my hometown and how that's developed my hobbies/kept me curious. Bubbly little essay, but again, not exactly ""wow""), What Matters (8 -- how family dinner has evolved over the years)
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): didn't read any, but here are my guesses
Teacher Rec #1: Bio teacher of 2 years, though I don't have him this year. Really enjoyed his class and he was very enthusiastic to do this (7 -- not ""best student ever"" or anything, but very positive)
Teacher Rec #2: English teacher of 2 years. Hands down most passionate teacher I've ever had, and such a good writer. (I'm guessing 8 for the same reasons)
Counselor Rec: Loved her! We met all the time and she even read over some of my essays. Knew me pretty well, and was always so warm (9?)
Additional Rec: Neurologist that I shadow on weekends (8 -- he probably had some good details that couldn't be captured by regular schoolteachers)

Congratulations to everyone who was accepted! All the deferred people, we have hope for regular, send out your other apps and keep your head up. People who were rejected, this doesn't mean you're an awful person and won't get anywhere in life, you're brilliant and will do great things one day, keep your heads high and apply away.

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I really have no idea, every counselor (high school and college) was confident in my admission, I had all the pieces, someone with lesser qualifications than me got in through Questbridge two weeks ago from my school and my only idea is that Stanford didn't feel like taking another person from our rural demographic

Ended with talking about how I transitioned to currently dealing with them with a better mindset and learned that some challenges are constant. (this is a pretty rough summary, sorry)
Extra Curric: 7, talked about working at Jimmy John's and how that has helped me speak more confidently and become more tolerant.
Intellectual Vitality: 10, discussed whether or not creativity truly existed. Combined my intended major (comp sci) and minor (music composition).
Roommate: 8, I personally didn't like this one, but everyone who read it did. I talked about how I'm very messy, but I have a neat whiteboard to collect all of my thoughts. Then I talked about how much I love food.
What matters: 10, talked about individuality and its necessity for innovation. Referred to my experience at the Stanford Pre-Collegiate Summer Institutes and how that opened my eyes to the possibilities that can be created through diversity.Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: 7. Social studies teacher, has known me since freshman year. However, his recommendations are pretty cookie-cutter style.
Teacher Rec #2: 8. Calculus teacher, has known me since last year. I didn't get to read it and I have no idea how he writes, but last year I exceeded his expectations and I always have a positive attitude in class, so that has to count for something.
Counselor Rec: 5. He didn't really know me well, so it was probably generic.
Additional Rec: 10. Old band director. I was able to read it, and it was very touching. Definitely highlighted the best of my qualities.

Weaknesses: test scores, other recs, didn't do anything too outstanding
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I think my essays and short answers showed my personality in the best way possible. They highlighted my sense of humor as well as my passion for computer science, music, and people. I'm still stunned - I've seen people on this forum who I'd consider to be way more qualified than myself that did not get accepted. Everything happens for a reason, and for whatever reason, Stanford accepted me!
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: N/A
General Comments: Clearly, test scores aren't everything, to an extent. For those who are applying in the future, I just hope that you take my advice and BE YOURSELF! Don't try to be some crazy person who wins every award and gets perfect scores and is involved in everything, if that isn't who you truly are. Do what you want to do - what makes YOU excited - and that's what schools will appreciate. Your passion will come out through your writing, and for Stanford at least, that's what counts.

Reflection
Strengths: Strength in my intended major, English (800 writing on SAT, 760 on SAT II Lit, 5 on AP English Lit, editor of school newspaper). Besides my roommate supplement, I think all my writings demonstrated my passion for writing and were well written.
Weaknesses: SAT score was on low side, especially in math section. I took all APs my school offers, but it’s half as much as most other schools have. Roommate supplement. No crazy awards. Not a ton of volunteer work.
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: My weaknesses listed above definitely factored in. John Arrillaga was pushing for me (look him up if you don’t know him…Stanford’s biggest benefactor) he stumbled across my writing and showed it to the head of admissions (I did NOT ask him to do this-I don’t know the guy personally). This could have hurt me more than it helped me, who knows.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Only other school I’ve heard from is Regis (safety school), with an acceptance! I also got 20k/yr merit scholarship there 
General Comments:
I go to a small school (less than 70 kids), and I’ve heard that some schools like Stanford don’t like that and worry about kids transitioning to big university life. Who knows…there is no way to tell why someone got accepted and another didn’t.
Honestly, I’m relieved. I got my rejection email today and it didn’t disappoint me. My heart was not in Stanford—it was a childhood fantasy, but I am not in love with Stanford at all. I am applying to so many other less prestigious and well known schools that I LOVE, and I know everything will work out in the end. For RD and future applicants: It’s important to keep a realistic perspective on this process. There is no magic formula for Stanford—the variety of people they accept is baffling. Their acceptance rate is now lower than any school in the Ivy League. Everything happens for a reason, and Stanford was not meant for me. Failure is a part of life, and it feels pretty damn good to have failed at this and still be smiling. ",Stanford,2019

Volunteer/Community service: Indy Zoo, Hamilton County Humane Society, Youth Group, and NHS are all service-based
Summer Activities: Copy/pasted from my application:
I've spent them riding and showing my horse, volunteering at the Indianapolis Zoo, volunteering at Vacation Bible School, participating in Youth Group, attending (horse) camps, and traveling. I came pretty late to the game for horseback riding, so I specifically blocked out my summers to grow as an equestrian.
Essays (rating 1-10, details):
Common App: About falling off of horses and what it has taught me, had many friends and family members edit it, Vanderbilt interviewer said she loved it and though it was ""mature and insightful""
Intellectual Vitality: About living in China (I lived there for four and a half years, moving back to the US after 8th grade) and how it led me to regard myself as a global citizen
Roommate: My personal favorite. I wrote a list of rules for my roommate that revealed a lot about myself and what I like on a more personal level (e.g. rule #6: Qdoba is now and forever superior to Chipotle) and ended by telling my roommate how we only stood a chance at being actually good friends if she challenged these rules.
What Matters: Fairytales, of the Disney variety, because they champion optimism in a cynical world.
Activity Elaboration: Talked about volunteering at the zoo and making connections between people and walruses
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: 10/10 Haven't seen these so speculating, but this was my AP Lit teacher and we were super tight––I spent a lot of extra time with all of my junior year teachers because I missed a lot of school that year and had to make up a lot of work. She asked me to send her a specific story from the class that she could incorporate into the letter and I talked about how I waited to read The Great Gatsby and why it is my favorite novel (I'm a cliche, I know)...she had a very high opinion of me.
Teacher Rec #2: 6/10 Not sure how this one turned out. I wanted one from a science/math teacher since that is the direction I want to go in, and my only junior year math/science teacher was my AP Chem teacher. I worked closely with her to make up work as well, so I asked her to write one. It would probably be slightly better than average because she knows me and my sister and had to work with me outside of class fairly often.
Counselor Rec: 8/10 My counselor also has a very high opinion of me. Again, saw a lot of her in my junior year because I missed a lot of school/had to rearrange my schedule a lot that year, and also because of National Merit, which is largely counselor driven. Love my counselor and this letter is probably pretty dece.
Additional Rec: None
Interview: Freaking Amazing. It was supposed to be 30-60 minutes and went for 90. My interviewer and I connected really well and had some excellent discussion. At the end she said she would pull for me as much as she could, she loved how open and intensely passionate I was, and she was sure I would do great things wherever I went and whatever I decided to do. Not gonna lie I was almost in tears knowing that we might never talk again, as alums are not supposed to contact those who get rejected. IN SUMMARY, it was the best case scenario.

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I literally have no idea how I got accepted. I am fully aware that all of my achievements can bring me furthest to just 20% or 25% pool of the applicants. But reducing down from 25 to 10 % is insane. Stanford has a lot of qualified students, they could not accept all. Perhaps, I actually belong with Stanford. It's my dream school. I gave it a shot, and I got in.

For people who're accepted, I can't wait to see u guys on campus.
For people who're deferred, I hope you get in for RD round.

General Comments:
I've had more than enough people tell me that I wouldn't get in because my SAT scores are too low or I didn't have enough leadership ECs or school-related ECs. Looking at stanford acceptances on college confidential didn't boost my confidence either, but I didn't want test scores to distract me with my hobbies. It's truly about finding your passion not worrying much about scores and grades.
To future applicants reading this: Scores/tests/grades are important, but they don't determine who you are and your desire to succeed. Don't let the high SAT scores and incredible ECs upset you like they upset me. In the end, showing that you have the desire to succeed and the passion to get you there is more important than showing that you can succeed with high scores.
General comments:
For people not accepted, don't worry about the rejection! In the end, we all have different opportunities that define what we can put on our applications. I was truly thankful that my recommender started a robotics foundation to allow me to pursue more opportunities. I recall entering high school when I choose a public high school over a prestigious private. In the end, I was much more happier at the public school because it was a much better fit for me.

Reflection
I honest-to-goodness did not think I would get in. I prayed my butt off and fasted for two days, so maybe that’s why I got in. I cried like a freaking infant and tore off my jacket and threw it on the floor when I found out. I don’t know if those are congruent symptoms of shock or what but that’s what happened. Then I fell on the floor and my mom and I just cried because we both didn’t think this was humanly possible, for me at least. I honestly didn’t see it coming, my test scores are so low. My essays honestly rocked though, both AP Lit teachers at my school thought they were good enough to get me in.
Strengths: I published a book and work for a magazine so that shows interest and dedication to me field. So basically extracurriculars and essays. My voice was really strong and unique in my essays.
Weaknesses: Test scores. So so so bad. Like if my kid got those scores I would chastise her into the ground.
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Hopefully this isn’t the chief reason, but being a minority probably helps. And my essays... they really kicked butt, I’m not afraid to say it. I legit like reading them! Plus, like I said, not many teens can say they’re a paid editor of a magazine nor a published author so that helps. Plus, I really care about what I do. Like I really, sincerely care about writing, teaching (as in tutoring and Sunday school), and music, so that’s why everything in my life revolves around those things. I think that shows in an application.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Nowhere yet. Applied to Harvard, Yale, UCI, and UCR. Applying to Scripps.
General Comments: To conclude, good luck to EVERYONE applying! Pray and send positive thoughts into the universe because if I can make it, anyone can. I always tell my friends “I’m not a real person yet”, but I finally feel like I am. It’s a great feeling, so keep working hard and you might get there! I heard something like this in a sermon once, but I think it applies quite well here too: Make sure you’re not a lake, that covers a lot of space but doesn’t go very deep. Also, don’t be a well that only goes deep in one area. Be an ocean, that spans miles and has great depth. Basically, do a lot, and be passionate. That’s the BEST advice I can give to prospective applicants. Also important is simply having fun. I shopped and hung out with friends in HS way more than I studied or worked on college apps. Everyone is different, but I think that if you focus on yourself more than anything else, colleges will view you as a “real person” and you’ll view yourself the same way, then that will show in your application!
Also I can’t wait to meet all of my potentially-future classmates! Message me so we can get to know one another before we embark on this next chapter of our lives together! Ahhh so exciting! Good luck again! ",Stanford,2019

Decision: Accepted
Objective:
SAT I (breakdown): 2240 800 Math 740 Reading 700 Writing
ACT (breakdown): Didn't take!
SAT II: 800 Math II, 750 Chemistry
Unweighted GPA (out of 4.0): 4.0
Rank (percentile if rank is unavailable): 1/353 Weighted/Unweighted
AP (place score in parenthesis): None
IB (place score in parenthesis): Math SL 7, Chemistry SL 6 (Took HL Math and HL Chem junior year)
Senior Year Course Load: IB English HL, IB History HL, IB Mandarin SL (Only SL yet manages to be my hardest class), IB Physics HL, IB TOK.
I was also accepted into the Reed Young Scholars program which allowed me to take math classes at Reed for free. I drive to the college from my high school twice a week. I just finished a Number Theory course, and I'm about to start an Analysis course.
Major Awards (USAMO, Intel etc.): Eagle Scout (Does this count?)
Subjective:
Extracurriculars (place leadership in parenthesis):
-Captain of chess team for two state championships.
-Eagle scout, senior patrol leader, some random awards for my eagle project.
-Unit captain on constitution team. Mock trial freshman year
-Cross Country 4 years
-Started project to make an open source dictionary for the Haian dialect of Chinese. (To be honest this is the biggest reason why I'm excited to have gotten in... I can continue this awesome project with Stanford backing)
-Lots of volunteering. Other random things.
Job/Work Experience:
Volunteer/Community service: Lots. Free Geek, Scouts mostly.
Summer Activities: Worked on Chinese project, Philmont Hike (120 miles), Part time job with Portland Chess Shop, finished eagle project and got eagle scout.
Essays (rating 1-10, details):
1. I think my common app essay was a 10/10. I wrote it about playing chess in the park and building a community through it.
2. Work experience was just about my part time job with PCC. Not too noteworthy, but added to the overall feel of the application. 10/10 for what it accomplished, 7/10 in terms of writing.
3. Short answers were quirky. I wrote ""Free cone day at Ben and Jerry's"" for one of my favorite events. Definitely didn't take it too seriously.
4. I honestly didn't feel as though my short essays were good, but they definitely added to the texture of my application. Again, I didn't take myself too seriously and I just talked about things that I'm passionate about. The roommate essay was actually based off of my experiences at the Stanford high school summer college in 2013. I talked about baking baklava, going on runs, and playing shogi in the quad. The roommate essay was definitely the best of the three.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: Math Teacher. I was in his Math SL and Math HL classes. I also TA'd for Math SL 1 my sophomore year. Had him three times overall and I think he wrote me an awesome letter. 9/10.
Teacher Rec #2: English teacher who I had a really good relationship with. She read my common application essay right before writing my letter of recommendation, and she told me that it inspired her to write a strong letter. 9.5/10.
Counselor Rec: No idea! My counselor was pretty animated about it though so I'm assuming it was good. Ill be conservative and say 8/10.
Additional Rec: None. You don't need these folks!
Interview: Honestly can't tell. Interviewer was a high powered neurosurgeon who pretty much just had a conversation with me for 50 minutes. He was pretty unreadable, but I talked about my Chinese dialect project and hopefully let him see a ""spark"".

Applied for Financial Aid?: No. My grandpa left behind a college fund, and we make enough that financial aid isn't really on the table.

School Type: Large Public School
Ethnicity: White
Gender: Male
Income Bracket: 150-200k
Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): Legacy
Reflection
Strengths:
Lot's of things. I found myself in a really good position while applying. The hardest part for me was getting things down on paper. Great applicants get rejected because they didn't have the time or the patience to get themselves down on paper in a way that truly reflects their amazingness.
Weaknesses:
Interview, and maybe some of my short essays. I poured everything I had into this application, so I tried to nip weaknesses at the bud early. My SAT scores are good (not great, but good), and I have good grades and a rigorous schedule. Again, I was put in a fantastic position to apply with and it was really just a matter of crafting the best on-paper application that I could.
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Hard-work, in high school and in the application. I think Legacy also might have helped, but I feel like my application was strong without it.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Nowhere else. I'm withdrawing all of my other applications tomorrow. No point in being a headhunter when I'm already satisfied with where I'm going. Waste of money, my application reader's time, and my own time for me to apply to other schools.
General Comments:
Overall I have to say that the biggest part of the application is giving them a feel for who you are as a person. An individual essay does not have to be fantastic as long as it adds a small piece to the puzzle of who you are. Talk about the things that you love doing, but also know that they don't want you to take yourself too seriously. Don't slip in outright jokes, but maybe give a few lighthearted answers.
I'm really excited to be a member of the Stanford Class of 2019. If anyone wants to ask me anything, just post in this thread or PM me and I'll get back to you. ",Stanford,2019

General Comments:
Wow. It feels great. It feels like my sense of self worth has been reassured, that a huge burden has been lifted from my shoulders. Isn't that messed up?? this decision shouldn't mean this much, and I'm confused about how to feel. So many of my friends were rejected, people I looked up to, respected, and even thought were smarter than I was. It gets so arbitrary at these top schools... as you all know... and there are simply too many qualified students to all fit. But I'm 100% that all of those students will go on to great schools and accomplish great things - I was just lucky that my first shot worked out. This will only define you if you let it, and I don't want it to define me! ",Stanford,2019

Common App: 10. I wrote about when I tried to start my own online business when I was 12 after winning a notional competition but not realizing the actual cost of the product and having to work over time. Also touched on my sister.
Intellectual Vitality: 9. Talked about computer science and how I had to teach myself from 8 years old and the pleasure I get from coding and the passion I have for it.
What Matters: 9. Talked about my sister and her disabilities and how what matters most to me is taking care of her throughout her life. Moved into talking about how helping kids with disabilities is rewarding and thus also matters. Worked pretty well, but not as good as my common app essay.
Letter To Roommate: 7. I used a very relaxed tone and talked about gymnastics, how I will have to take them to our meets, and in general was lighthearted and joking.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): We don’t get to read any of our recs but having such a small class size they are extremely personal
Teacher Rec #1: 10 - Head Master (who is my Greek Teacher). Didn’t specifically read this one but have read other recs he has done for me and it is top notch (best writer i have ever read, better than most authors xD)
Teacher Rec #2: 9 English teacher from Junior year. Loved me (called me the only member of the ‘intelligencia’ he had met in a long while in a conversation).
Counselor Rec: 10 - Highlights almost everything I left out in my own essays and emphasizes my intellectual curiosity. Since we have so few students broken up over 3 counselors they are very personalized. Plus he graduated from Stanford 
Additional Rec: 8 - Computer science teacher from past 3 years. He has repeatedly called me the best student he has ever had and better than most professional computer scientists that he has known. As a comp sci teacher, however, his writing was most likely not even close to my other three recs.
Interview: Not offered.

Reflection
Strengths: Strong extracurricular/international or national awards. My essays really shined and showed the ""human"" side of me, because my ECs showed how much of a machine I am (secretly). Twas a nice balance.
Weaknesses: I hate standardized testing. But I can't complain, I have to say I'm satisfied with the scores I ended up with (after taking it soooo many times.... finally...). I had a lot of ECs, and I only have so much time to focus on a few specific ones, so I maybe stood off as trying to be too involved. (i.e. Scioly and math league, like I never spent any time preparing for them so I never really did well... :P)
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Honestly, when it comes down to 10% acceptance rate, it's a bit like asking to win the lottery. Very holistic and arbitrary; who knows?? Maybe the admission officers were just having a good day?
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: NADA! Stanford's the first one. Pretty nice gift before the break!!! 
General Comments: For real though, this is the real life. I bawled my eyes out the minute I got my email, and then bawled for the next few hours before I went to sleep (if I even went to sleep at all....). Still in disbelief and shock - I've been refreshing my email frantically, making sure that they won't send an email saying it was a fluke (which has totally happened to me before with one of those prestigious summer research programs... can't remember which one). Essay advice, just be yourself. To be honest, I didn't let anyone check my essays and just trusted my gut instinct. And wrote them with a month left to go. You just have to wait for that spark of inspiration; you can't force words to come out. I am so thankful that this has happened to me - so many negative events have happened and I sort of just broke down into a bundle of nerves; but in retrospect, good things will come to those who wait. Always be optimistic - even if you get rejected, there's always other colleges out there. I'm sure you will find the perfect match for you.  And if you got deferred, keep those spirits up!! You're one of those rare cases that Stanford values enough to keep in the running. I believe in every single one of you. No matter what happens, never stop loving yourself, because that's all that will matter in the end. ",Stanford,2019

ACT (breakdown): Took it but didn't submit. Parents were concerned SAT was reasoning and ACT was more recall and that college could delineate the differences. Honestly, it doesn't matter.

Unweighted GPA (out of 4.0): 4.0

AP (place score in parenthesis): 5's on Physics B, Physics C M, Physics C E, Biology, AP Calc AB, AP Calc BC, US History, Chemistry, Language and Composition, Computer Science
IB (place score in parenthesis): No IB Program
Senior Year Course Load: Four academic classes, one leadership, one music, one physical education (because graduation requirements)
Major Awards (USAMO, Intel etc.): National Science Bowl, USABO Semi-Finalist, Physics Bowl (Awards not specified cause identity), International Physics Report competition (not specified cause identity), High School Mathematics Modeling Contest National Finalist, National ASTA All-National Orchestra. (Couple other awards from Science Olympiad, FBLA, National Spanish Exam, AP, Science Fairs, Toshiba Exploravision, Young Naturalist, California Certificate of Merit)
Subjective:
Extracurriculars (place leadership in parenthesis): Spanish Club (Currently President), FBLA(Currently President), Science Club(Currently President and Captain of Science Bowl), Student Government (Tech Commissioner and Treasurer)
Job/Work Experience: Never got paid for any of my work sadly so its all ""volunteer but not volunteer""
Volunteer/Community service: Research lab, taught local communities science, political interning (I don't have strong community service. I didn't create my own 501c3 nonprofit organization and I personally feel that it does nothing unless you truly are impassioned about a certain cause and you are doing it more for service than getting into college.)
Summer Activities: Research. Always research or something related to helping students with science. Took some classes for remedial benefits or to enhance my knowledge of science/math. Would recommend you start classes before high school.
Essays (rating 1-10, details): 7-9 overall
1) Common App: Leadership, passion for entrepreneurship/building organizations. Strong essay.
2) Extracurricular: Research
3) Intellectal Vitality: Computer Science. Dabbled in mobile apps/websites/hacking competitions
4) Future Roommate: Fried Chicken nuff said. (Talked about how it related to my personality)
5) What matters?: Music. Talked about determination.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
1) Science Teacher: Pretty decent I would say. Was president/captain for two of his clubs, been in both his clubs for pretty much my entire high school career, and traveled with him on science competition. We have a great deal of mutual respect for each other. Strong writing on leadership/academics I presume.
2) Spanish Teacher: Very good. Mutual respect and she perceives me as a very kind, generous individual. She was the only person I discussed family tragedies with because she was approachable and we both experienced loss. Connected with her on an emotional basis. Strong writing on personal qualities I presume.
3) Research Professor: Unsure. He doesn't know me on a personal level, but I worked for him since I was a freshman...attended barbeques and lunches with him and group meetings. Very nice fellow. Very generous. Decent to Strong writing about my research experience and involvement in my high school.
4) Counselor: Pretty much just fed her information about my extracurriculars. I think there's a formula to how they write rec letters to make it easy, but I was pretty descriptive with my involvement. Would recommend you actually are INVOLVED in your extracurriculars. If you simply view them as ""padding"", you won't be able to talk about them to anyone.

Strengths: Uh...very well-rounded? I guess Stanford likes determination/passion for entrepreneurship

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Was a pretty strong candidate at my school. Upon realization that the acceptance rate was 10.2% and reading a lot these profiles...I honestly don't know. Could be essays or rec letters.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: N/A
General Comments: As an asian male growing up in a pretty competitive environment, I will have to emphasize two things. 1) Start early. I know that you are still searching, but if you love the humanities or you love the sciences...start early! Learn more, get ahead, and push yourself. Have a great support group with friends and family. They are the ones that will guide you through your toughest times. 2) Do what you love. Don't follow my profile or someone else's profile exactly because you ""think it works"". Everyone is unique. Present yourself as a determined, passionate person who loves to do what he/she does and is successful despite failures and you will be seen as a go-getter and a driven individual. A person with potential whose ideas are not framed by your parents, but by yourself. ",Stanford,2019

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I just wrote frankly and openly and did things that interested me, but I am still in shock
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Stanford wasn't my first choice initially, but after talking to a few from MIT and judging from a few that were admitted to MIT from my school over the past 4 years among other brighter ones who were turned down, I was completely turned off and decided to switch my MIT EA to Stanford REA. I am so glad I made the switch about 30 days before the applications were due.

Essays (rating 1-10, details):

Intellectual Vitality (9): talked about when I met the Consulate General at the Italian Embassy when I was 12 and how since she was a women in politics, it impacted me to study IR and join Model UN.
Roommate (10): I presented myself as having two personalities, one as the type A always crazed and busy girl and the other as a chill, type B surfer. Probably the best essay I've ever written.
What Matters? (9): Spoke about the role of motion in my life and how it has affected everything and anything that I do.

Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): URM, probably some of the strangest EC's they've seen and sent an arts supplement
Reflection: I honestly was not expecting this at all, only one other person from my school has ever gotten in and that was almost a decade ago! If I were to guess why I got in, it would have to be the essays.. it took me almost two and a half months to do four essays! They really want to see passion and that you stick with something that you love. And if you want to go to Stanford, JUST APPLY.. you never know, seriously. Good luck to anyone that was deferred, and to anyone that was rejected, even applying to Stanford means something, and it most likely means that you are extremely gifted and will thrive wherever you end up. Things happen for a reason and you always end up where you are supposed to!
Strengths: ESSAYS and strange EC's
Weaknesses: no major awards, most of my EC's were athletic and not academic based
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: like I said above, passion and sticking with something that I loved.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Nowhere yet, though I may pull the rest of my apps and just be done

Weaknesses: SAT IIs (what a joke), essays were some of the worst I've ever written, I'm not extraordinary at all
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I think what pushed me over were my recs. I was certain I would be rejected because of my SAT IIs and my essays. But my recs really tied together the disjointed, interested-in-everything person I communicated through my application. I LOVE YOU MR. ANDERSON AND MR. TOSTADO AND MS. MARQUEZ 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Accepted at Purdue; waiting RD on Cal Poly SLO, UCB, UCLA, UCSD, UCD, UCSB; applying RD to Yale, Caltech, UPenn, Rice, Carnegie Mellon, Princeton (removed Georgia Tech and Columbia after Stanford acceptance) (swag)
General Comments: Hey, you. It's 2015, you're reading the decisions thread (like I always did for so many desperate hours), and you're shaking and sweating as you see these perfect kids get rejected for no reason. It's terrifying. It's disheartening. You don't even want to apply. You shouldn't have applied. How could you even stand a chance? Well, guess what? You do stand a chance. Close the multiple CC tabs you have open, pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and go work on the applications you're procrastinating on. You can only compare yourself to yourself, and if you HAVE to compare against other people, do it on the Naviance graphs that show the acceptances from your high school. I believe in you, your family believes in you, and your school believes in you - but we don't believe in what university you'll attend, but what you'll do with your entire life. I hope my mediocre application gives you the hope you need to drag yourself out of the clutches of CC. You accomplish nothing by dwelling on results threads - go out and do great things! Your world is counting on you! And always, always, always remain aware of your true motivations! I believe that you will win  ",Stanford,2019

Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Nothing yet. Applied/applying to UChicago, Northwestern, Claremont-McKenna, UC-Berkeley, Haverford, Carnegie Mellon, and Lafayette. Before you call me out on my lack of Ivies, I want to say that I honestly couldn't think of a non-prestige-related reason to go to any of them (I know that sounds insane, but just believe me).
General Comments:
I honestly expected rejection. Yet they valued me enough to defer me.
I just lacked some prestigious award, some grand charity project, some random interest.
Judging by this thread, it appears I am in very good company in my deferral...

Teacher Rec #1: 8/10, physics teacher from junior year. We had a great relationship and I did very well in his class
Teacher Rec #2: 8/10, government teacher/model UN supervisor. Really liked me, did well in his class, and helped him run his political campaign.
Counselor Rec:9/10, we had a very good relationship and he probably added several very unique details about me/my involvement at school
Additional Rec: 9/10, my research mentor from over the summer. Spoke about both my abilities in the lab and my social tendencies

Essays (rating 1-10, details):
Commonapp Essay:
7-8 I reckon
Question: Reflect on a time when you challenged a belief or idea
Talked about challenging my high school's belief that general knowledge and trivia facts are boring and in general useless by organising the inaugural general knowledge and trivia competition on campus. Revealed my passion for general knowledge and my willingness to explore uncharted territories and to take initiatives.
Extracurricular Activities Essay:
9
Talked about how the secondary students inspired me with a new approach to learning when I prepared them for an astronomy competition.
Short Questions:
9
Done in a rather humorous tune. Talked about things that I truly love.
Intellectual Vitality Essay:
8-9
Talked about the first time I found Sirius through my telescope.Revealed my passion for astronomy and curiosity for what's up there in the sky.
Future Roommate Essay:
10
I reckon this is the most creative one among all. Basically, I was inspired by the Stanford undergraduate admission webpage. So I named my essay roommate 'admission' and divided it into five parts to talk about the various aspects of dorm life: The basics, The application process (there is no fee 'cause I believe friendship is priceless and no deadline as you are always welcomed.), The Dorm experience, The Room perspective and The Place.
What matters to you, and why?:
9
Comics. I have been fond of reading and drawing comics since primary school and never stopped ever since. But I
went one step further and discussed the attitude comics represents, an attitude that life, no matter how brutal, should always be approached with a smile.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: 10. From my Physics teacher. It was extremely detailed and talked about my in-class performance,
my curiosity and my role as the physics representative of the class.
Teacher Rec #2: 7-8. From my General Paper teacher. He liked me and I guess the rec letter is pretty solid.
Counselor Rec: 8-9. Pretty detailed and talked about some of the major aspects of my two years in Junior College.
Additional Rec: 8-9. From a teacher who mentored me in various projects including the general knowledge
competition I initiated. He was also my CCA teacher. We are like friends and the rec letter really
offered a new perspective to my application.
Interview: 8. It went pretty well although I was a bit nervous at the beginning. Chatted for about 2 hours at Starbucks.

General Comments:
I believe 'to fit' the college/university you are applying to is really important. Before applying, take a few days and really do some serious research into the universities you THINK you like. Look into yourself and really understand who you are and what are your characteristics. And as said and emphasised by many, I think the essays and recommendation letters are very important to your application, those are the things that set you apart.
All the best to all those who are applying and please DO believe your hard work of trying to understand yourself and writing creatively will pay off in the end!

@flyingwatermelon : The Stanford website is quite clear about the SAT and the ACT: - ""If you take both tests, all scores are required from both"" (from the Stanford Freshman Application Instructions at http://admission.stanford.edu/pdf/AppGuideFreshman.pdf ).
I point this out primarily for any future applicants reading this thread. They need to know that if they have taken both the SAT and ACT, they are supposed to report all scores from both tests. If they choose to not send ACTs, they are not complying with Stanford's policy. There should be no confusion from your original results post.
Whether you would have been admitted anyway, is not my point. I do believe this was an inadvertant mistake on your part, otherwise you would not have posted that you did this on cc. What, if anything, you choose to do about it now is, of course, none of my business. ",Stanford,2019

Reflection
Strengths: Test scores, math accomplishments, teacher recs, community service, class rigor.
Weaknesses: Grades (huge huge huge), lack of leaderships
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected:
My grades made this a longshot from the beginning. No one's ever got a top 10 school with a gpa this low unless they were legacy. Not to mention that my grades were on a downwards trend. All because of one english teacher who grades ridiculously hard and disliked me (caught me doing other homework in class). My advice is not to take ap classes you aren't sure you'll get good grades in, counselors generally tick of max rigor as long as you take a fair number of AP classes, avoid the hard ones.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Haven't heard from anywhere else yet
General Comments: Congrats to those that got in. I realized I never really played the college game (sucking up, working with little sleep on drugs like caffeine pills, aderall or cutting out my time wasting) to the extent needed to get in. I'm somewhat lazy, like to get a reasonable amount of sleep, and piss off people instead of pleasing them; I didn't really deserve to get in. If you want to get into Stanford (or a school of its ilk in selectivity), be prepared to play these games unless you have a hook or are IMO/IpHO/IChO/IBO/Intel finalist level talent.
The process isn't as random as it seems, I predicted most of the early applications from the schools in my area. Play your cards correctly, I did not, and hence i was rejected. Prob would have got in if I kept my gpa 3.98.
And there's always transfer admit (although it's a ridiculous longshot). ",Stanford,2019

Also forgot to note in the above post, I had additionally taken Calculus III (Multivariable Calculus) at my high school (dual credit with community college) and Linear Algebra with Differential Equations at my local top 40 university (full-tuition scholarship) (As on both courses). ",Stanford,2019

Reflection:
Strengths: awards and recs
Weaknesses: Grades (I had straight A's except for 1 B in one semester of 10th grade English)
Overall: Before you get into high school make sure you're super good at math and abstract thinking as this makes the AP science and math classes a breeze, also read a ton of books and write essays/blogs on topics of your choice to improve your writing, email professors your research proposals (they're really friendly - mostly - and some might accept you). Get really good at public speaking too, I started doing national/international science fairs in 6th grade so by the time I was in 9th grade I could have a ton of experience.
General Comments: SOOOO EXCITEEEED!!!!! You don't have to have no social life to get into these schools, I always got at least 6 hours of sleep and could watch T.V and hang out with my friends. Also you don't have to have perfect grades, I got one B but I still ended up 1st in class by taking a bunch of APs. Can't wait to see everyone in September  ",Stanford,2019

Objective:
SAT I (breakdown): Applied with 1980 (CR650 W620 M710) - Now 2100 (CR680 W660 M760)
ACT: N/A
SAT II: Did not send on REA, sent after defferal - 720 M2 640BM - going to retake on january.
Unweighted GPA (out of 4.0): sent 93 - probably will be 91 after a terible senior mid-year report. My school is strict on attendance, and I have missed a lot of classes because of ECs.
Rank (percentile if rank is unavailable): top 10%, even if I fail all my classes this year.
Senior Year Course Load: Hardest in my school, but by names I have half the classes I had in Junior year (although in hours quite the same).

Extracurriculars (place leadership in parenthesis): National Youth Council(represent 30,000 youth); District Youth Council(Secretary General); Regional Youth Council(Secretary General); Political party youth wing; Martial arts (black belt); Running (Half a marathon on a monthly basis).
Summer Activities: Motorcycle trip with my father, surfing, starting to learn french, running.
Essays (rating 1-10, details):
Common app 9-10/10 - talked about the elections that I didn't succeed in, and elegantly also discussed my especifically low voice.
Vitality - a shortened version of my Princeton & Yale application essay, I wasn't able to retain all of its merit, but it felt pretty good. 8-10/10
Roommate - really felt like myself in it: 9-10/10
Matters - with no one to evaluate it, I have no idea how good it is. 8-10/10
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Both teachers loved me, and theirs were some of only classes that didn't bore me to death. Those was the first recs they wrote though, couldn't predict how it went, probably 8-10/10
Counselor Rec: We don't have a councelor, the homeroom teacher wrote my rec. I love her, but I don't think she can write a meaningful rec, she didn't know me outside the two hours a week she had seen me.
Additional Rec: Regional council's advisor; the adult I connected most with at my time in the youth council. 10/10 most likely.

Why you think you were deferred: I told them about all the tests I am going to take after REA deadline, either they were playing hard to get, or they genuinely wanted to evaluate me at my final stage, and in the context of the entire pool of applicants.
General Comments: I live in a place with a different mentality. My friends didn't truely understand what I was doing trying to get in; none of them will even think about higher education for the next couple of years. This forum and its members really did help by showing me that there are others, real people, who actualy go through the same process. I do hope that if I get in, I would meet you guys there.

Just be honest on your essays and it will come naturally. I had writers block for a long time because I kept thinking ""I have to be special, I have to seem like a god if I want Stanford to accept me."" But when I just said ""**** it"" and started writing the truth and nothing but the truth, the words just came naturally and cleanly. Sure, my essays highlighted some of my flaws (for example, that I was a slacker in middle school), I didn't seem like a god when you read my essays, but they made me seem so... human. Which, in my opinion, is better than being a god. My essays were THE greatest part of my application, they should be yours too and the only way that'll happen is if you tell your actual story.

Reflection
Strengths: SUMaC, no EC fatigue by spreading myself out too much, shows dedication to one thing, theater. Enough grades to get past the threshold, but also amazing course rigor showing I'm challenging myself. My essays were pretty original and very honest. They just talked about me as a person.
Weaknesses: Sometimes my essays felt a little weak. I thought they were slightly too video game centric at times, and sometimes my writing seemed a little scattered.
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I think SUMaC was probably a major factor. It got me interested in Stanford in the first place.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Early, none others but local schools.
General Comments: Be honest in your essays. Let them get to know you. Perfect test scores aren't that important, they just want a certain level so they know you are capable of doing their classes. If you can get into SUMaC, I think it's a major leg up. And if you don't get in, there are tons of other good schools and you only need to get into 1. I'll probably get rejected from some of the other top schools (applying for financial aid reasons, probably going to Stanford.) Good luck everyone! ",Stanford,2018

This surprisingly didn't hurt that much, partially because I had been starting to doubt whether I really wanted to attend Stanford or not towards the end. I don't want to sound like one of those people who says that just because they're bitter, but I realized that since I still wanted to continue something in art, I might be better off going somewhere else to play to my strengths. Anyway, I didn't have a spectacular application or anything, so this wasn't too shocking for me. Was disappointed that my arts supplement didn't make a difference though.

General Comments: Stanford is the hardest school to get in to in the United States, and it gets worse for Asians applying from California. I love being Asian though (best food evar), and made it clear at various parts of my application, for better or for worse. Plus all the legacy and athlete spots (they totally deserve it, just pointing out that there's barely any space for a regular person to get in as is) are reserved for EA. Not too bummed about the rejection, since I was fully expecting one. It would have been nice to be done with college apps, but looks like it's time to start in full force. The essays I have now are pretty solid, though, and I'm sure that they'll get me into college across the country.
And I'd been thinking about other schools a lot as the decision date neared. I'm pretty glad I didn't get in to Stanford, actually, because we all know it's a bubble. While I'd love to be part of it, I can see that going to Stanford would have hindered my music career (which may or may not take off). Looking at colleges in cities with a big music scene right now, so MIT, UC Berkeley, and UCLA are particularly enticing. CMU also has a cool Music program in the CS department, and trying for Princeton, Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, UChicago (house producer's dream school, I tell ya), and Caltech as well. ",Stanford,2018

Weaknesses: SAT scores not super awesome, maybe more volunteer hours too in greater commitments, only summer activity a one week medical conference
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I know that Stanford really takes into account the essay portion of the app, and while I liked my essays, Stanford may have wanted more from me. If my test scores may have been a bit higher, I also probably would have been a lot more competitive.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: None yet
General Comments: When it came down to it, I really was expecting a rejection. Everyone always told me that I would easily get in, but I knew that it was a lot harder than that so I was preparing for the worst. Even though I have been hung up on this school for a long time, right now I'm trying to remind myself that getting in would have been like winning the lottery, and I have plenty of other schools to wait for decisions from. Posting on here is a huge relief, because now I just want to move on and focus on the other stuff. Congrats to all of the admits!!! ",Stanford,2018

Summer Activities:
Spent pretty much every summer at school working on StuCo stuff
Essays (rating 1-10, details):
Honestly can't rate my essays. I hate everything I write so it would be biased.
My common app essay was about producing EDM. I discussed why I enjoy my hobby so much, mainly talked about how it's challenged because I'm essentially on my own and have to figure everything out for myself.
Intellectual vitality was about this time that I accidentally wrote down the wrong page number for my calc homework and then proceeded to learn the next three weeks of material for fun.
Roommate essay was just bad. I couldn't figure out what I wanted to write so I put it off and then bs'd it at the last minute
What matters essay was about asking questions. Talked about how I want to go into physics and learn the mysteries of the universe. It was alright I guess.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: AP Lang teacher. We have a really good relationship, letter was very well written
Teacher Rec #2: AP Calc teacher from last year. Said I was one of the best students she's ever had in 15+ years of teaching, also very good
Counselor Rec: Didn't read it but I'm one of the few students that he actually knows well so I'm sure it was good
Additional Rec: One from my StuCo advisor. It was great. Basically talked about all of the different ways that I've tried to make the school a better place. Spoke very highly of me.

Strengths: Leadership mainly. StuCo has been my thing for a very long time. Also I planned a ton of successful community service events. So although I got rejected, at least I got two Honduran kids into school hahaha
Weaknesses: Course rigor maybe. Lack of preparation. Meh essays. I don't really know honestly haha.
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Honestly don't have a clue. I wasn't expecting to get accepted, but I do think I had a decent shot. Just one of those things where it basically comes down to luck. When you're competing against 7000 highly qualified and awesome people for 700 spots, it's kind of a crapshoot.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Applied to USC and UC schools. Gonna start applying to a ton more, we'll see how that goes.
General Comments:
I'm surprisingly okay right now. My family and friends had more of a reaction than I did. They all expected me to get in, but I knew I was doomed from the start haha. My only regret is that I didn't try harder in school until last year. I never realized that I was actually pretty intelligent up until last year. At the beginning of the year, I decided that precalc was too easy, and I switched into AP Calc. Because of schedule conflicts, I ended up having to take 4 AP classes last year, which I did not anticipate. I ended up doing really really well (was one of 3 people in my class of 525 to get all A's last year. Our valedictorian didn't even get straight A's). I never realized that I was actually a pretty bright kid until last year. So if I could go back and do it again, I would take every AP class I could and not screw around freshmen year, get involved in more clubs than just StuCo, stuff like that. Also I think my biggest mistake was my essays. I over analyzed them too much. I was freaking out trying to write the ""perfect essay"" when I should have just wrote something that was really meaningful to me. Oh well, at least I learned something for my other applications  congrats to everyone who was admitted! ",Stanford,2018

I understand that 5.7% is pretty much a toss up for acceptance but I kind of wish I would have been deferred first instead. There's a lot I can say, and have said, to express how upset I am but it probably isn't helpful at this point. I guess I should just be optimistic about this and see it as an opportunity to discover new things. If you think about it, not a lot has changed really.

I just thought Stanford would care about him being constantly diligent and hard-working student but perhaps his low SAT made an influence. We are originally from the country Georgia and I thought my son stressed that too much in his essay (he is more of American now than Georgian, really) and perhaps Stanford didn't like it. Who knows.
Congratulations to everyone who got in, and good luck!!!

Major Awards (USAMO, Intel etc.): AP Scholar, National Merit Semi-Finalist, Scholastic Silver Key, Bausch & Lomb Honorary Science award.... nothing too ""major"" haha
Subjective:
Extracurriculars (place leadership in parenthesis): Very, very normal and probably mediocre by CC standards. Tutoring, clubs, volunteering - nothing standout and very little leadership (I co-founded a club though, which is pretty much the extent)
Job/Work Experience: none ha I tried a job once and they never called me back
Volunteer/Community service: I volunteer fairly regularly at a Holocaust Center and I was in Key Club last year but nothing too crazy, maybe like 60 hours total?
Summer Activities: Summer of 2012 I lost 30 pounds, and summer of 2013 I did a course in Egyptology at the University of Chicago
Essays (rating 1-10, details): I'm not going to rate my essays but I can say that I was very proud of them and how they made me seem as a person - I'm not super driven or a born leader, but I am a reflective and thoughtful person and I made sure my essays were super down-to-earth.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details):
Teacher Rec #1: My AP Psych teacher: she has had so much influence on me and ultimately, she's the one who got me interested in the social sciences. I didn't read it, but I guess it was good? She liked me a lot
Teacher Rec #2: My Precalc teacher: My counselor wanted me to ask her because he thought I should show that I'm equally good at both humanities/social studies and math/science. Still, I was a good math student and she did like me, so I guess it helped!
Counselor Rec: He's new and started spring of my junior year but we hit it off immediately, he's like a dad to me

Reflection
Strengths: Scores, legacy, essays (I think? I mean I doubt I would have gotten in if they were bad)
Weaknesses: Literally every other subjective thing. My EC's suck oh my god you guys would cry if you saw them
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I think I came across as really likeable. My biggest worry was that I didn't seem ""smart enough"" for Stanford - I write in like, artistic run-ons and I have no real national accomplishments or anything to show that I'm bright, but I guess they saw something in me? Also legacy must have helped
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Rutgers was my safety school and I got in there a couple months ago, but now I'm waiting on a bunch of match schools. It'll probably be Stanford for me, though, unless I get into Yale (in my dreams???)
General Comments: I am honestly shocked. I was not expecting this at all, I didn't even LET myself expect it because I knew I would be disappointed, and when I read the word ""Congratulations"" I screamed ""IS THIS A JOKE??"" I was certain they were going to follow it up and be like ""Sorry, we sent you that email by accident, you're actually rejected"" but it's been five and a half hours at this point and I just .... oh my God, STANFORD. I thought I had a negative chance oh my God I am eternally grateful that they saw something in me. Congratulations to all the other accepted students, I hopefully will see you next year! And to those deferred/rejected, I am so sorry but honestly this decision does not define you or your hard work or your spirit one bit, and some other amazing school is going to see all you put into your application and they will make Stanford sorry for ever letting you go.

Strengths: I thought that I stood out, especially among the Asian-american population by doing unique extracurricular activities and starting my own social enterprise. Personally, my essays were very strong and honest. SAT scores were up there as well but I'm not sure my November SAT (the one where I upped my reading from a 670 to a 770) got there in time.
Weaknesses:Had a few B's over the course of my highschool career but I know that is not a deciding factor. Did not get the SAT score in time? Perhaps the interview? (I thought it went well). Overall, it comes down to the statistics, what the school is looking for and the competition you are going against.

Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected:
General Comments: Holistically, I think this is a great test of my character and what I stated about myself in my essays. As today's decision date come closer and closer I started to lose more of my own personal values and get wrapped up about an email. Getting accepted to Stanford would absolutely have been amazing; however, getting into the most prestigious college is NOT the most important thing in the world and I feel that this experience made me realize again what is truly important. I am glad that I took a shot at the early action and am much happier with a rejection than the potential feeling of ""what if I had applied?"" Looking through the list, there are a good number of phenomenal candidates who got rejected and wait-listed so to anyone who is reading this: keep your head up. Stanford isn't the only place where you can be happy for the next four years. Sorry for being preachy; much respect and congratulations to those who got in and good luck to those who are applying elsewhere! ",Stanford,2018

Weaknesses: Some essays, in which I may not have expressed my thoughts diligently, my high school
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I understand that the acceptance rate is very low, and that the chosen few were identified among an already self-selecting group. At the same time, I was bound to fail, since my high school is overshadowed by multiple others in my state, which are considered ""feeder"" schools of sorts to the top colleges. Historically, my school has only been able to send a handful of students to the Ivies and similar schools, and if the students applying were considered a URM.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected:
Accepted: MSU, Pitt, Alabama, UCF, Wayne State, U of M Dearborn
General Comments: If Stanford could be imagined as a person, I'd see it as my dream girl. Sorry for the odd metaphor, haha. But I've seriously been in love with this school, and obviously decided to at least give it a shot. I'm glad that I mentally prepared myself for rejection from the very beginning, however, by thinking realistically. I would've been shocked if I did get in, to be quite honest. On another note, I truly want to congratulate those who did make it in, because you truly deserved it! Congrats, and I hope you attend this great college. While I wasn't given the chance to do so, I have decided to work my butt off so I can get in for graduate school. One way or another, I'm coming for you, Stanford! ",Stanford,2018

General Comments:
People tell you that decisions like these will take a while to sink in, and you may not be able to imagine what that is like, but it's true. It still hasn't really hit me that I'll be spending the next 4+ years at my dream school. Maybe it will tomorrow. To all those rejected: keep your head up. Remember what we wrote just a few days ago. To the deferred: stay strong and push through until the end; your odds are better than most. To my future Stanford siblings: remember that we are not invincible.
I find the notion that ""if you deserve to get in, you'll get in"" extraordinarily damaging. I'm sure that several candidates more qualified than me were rejected. Maybe that's because of warped affirmative action policy. Maybe it's just luck. Regardless of these factors, those candidates will go on to build fantastic futures at distinguished institutions. The process really is random in some ways, and if anyone tells you otherwise, ask them to back up their words with a source.
In terms of general application advice, go nuts on the essays. The line for ridiculousness is apparently very hard to cross. DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE the impact of making an admissions officer smile. I agree with all those who say that essays are the deciding factor at many elite schools. Write something that sounds good in your head. Don't take all the advice people give you. Your essays are yours and yours only, so make them your b*tch.
My sincerest regards go out to all applicants, accepted, deferred, or denied. People on CC amaze me every day. Keep being amazing: certainly you don't need to go to some gigantic Mexican restaurant for your undergraduate education to do so. ",Stanford,2018

General Comments:
I'm not afraid to say that I'm really bummed I got rejected. Over the course of applying, I fell in love with Stanford because I realized it was the only school in the world where I would truly be rewarded for being as well-rounded as I am. At any other school, my EC's and grades and service would be over-the-top more than I need to get in. I guess at Stanford they just were not enough. My counselor received a called from one of the Admissions counselors about a week ago, saying that they were looking over my app and it looked really good and I made it through the first selection process. At that point, my counselor basically told me I would get in, the first to ever accomplish this in my school's history. My friends started celebrating for me and I honestly got my hopes up. Needless to say, it was tough opening that email last night. Congrats to everybody who gets in. This is truly a school of very highly qualified students. ",Stanford,2018

No where else yet.General Comments: I was humbled by the fact that I got rejected because it shows no matter how well you score, or are economically/racially diverse, it is brutally difficult to get an education at a top tier college. It was my dream to go to Stanford, and so was my family's for pretty much all their lives, but I guess it was not mean to be.

General Comments: Thought she actually had a ""good chance"", whatever that translates to. Obviously, every parent thinks their child is amazing but everyone who meets her also says she is amazing. Stanford doesn't directly admit that they make mistakes but they clearly do. There are numerous individuals on this and past threads to prove it. Once you take out all the athletes, legacies, Intel Finalists, Mother Theresa's, etc. there is just not much left of the 11%.

Strengths:I thought I was a pretty well-rounded student with pretty good academics and extracurriculars
Weaknesses:I just wasn't the best in everything sadly, and I was unable to do anything unique. I was going to participate in a medicine abroad program in Mexico, but the country was too violent for my parents to tolerate and I really think that experience would have put me on par with those that were accepted. Volunteer work was probably a bit low, and my essays could have used a lot of personality. I was so afraid that I would lose formality in my essays by putting in too much wit or humor and in the end they were way to structural.
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I am not the best. I could have actually studied for the standardized tests (I winged every one and as such could not boost my SAT superscore, and I absolutely hated the ACT)
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected:

this was my only EDGeneral Comments: There are B's in high school that were entirely my fault, and I definitely regret them. Aside from these regrets, and worrying what I could have done, I get to look to what I can do. Someday I'll end up at Stanford (my dream as a child) and for those of you who are already in, congrats, and cherish it! Don't think I won't apply again in four years for grad school!

General Comments/Advice/Hindsight: Was pretty upset for quite a while although I should not have been considering my stats and the fact that it was Stanford… I had a friend who passed away during soph year who LOVED Stanford and I thought I could get in for her (I LOVE Stanford too…..) Anyways filling this out and posting it is sort of a healing process. I don’t regret applying cause well, as Mark Twain said, “Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do.” To all potential applicants reading this, please do not hesitate to apply even if your stats are similar to mine, even if rejected, I doubt you’ll regret giving yourself the chance. Remember, it’s 100% going to be “rejection” if you don’t apply! To the accepted ones, YOU DESERVE IT, and please do know how lucky you all are to have the chance to matriculate into this amazing school. ",Stanford,2018

General Comments:
I will use this section to vent my excitement and tell you all my life story, I have always wanted to be a Lawyer, my father heard this on his death bed as he died from cancer 9 years ago, he told me to always reach higher than told, right before they made me leave to give him his last anesthesia. Once I heard those inspiring words, I always tried my hardest, I fought countless times to achieve higher than anyone else, I did not stop studying, making Straight As or reaching anywhere under 2 times my capability, I did not care that I was overworked, I only needed to do what I had to, to achieve what my dad had, I made perfect scores on ERBs, ISEEs,SSATs SHSATs, and ACTs(unfortunately, not SATs.) I got into A charter school, not a prep, so I could boost my chances for a top school, and save my mom's money for college + grad school. Now that I will see the class of 2018 this fall, I know that I do not have many troubles ahead of me until I can reach the top of the shelf. ",Stanford,2018

@chancemeonthis
1. On Feb 20th you said you are a junior.
2. You didn't know what ED was and then posted: ""I am Early Decision, If I get into Stanford I will Go there.""
3. You claim a full scholarship and yet have a family income of 200k
4. You claim that you submitted 3 teacher recs and a Coach recommendation and one of those recommendations was a PE teacher? May want to check what Stanford requires and accepts.
So why are you posting here that you got in SCEA? What is that about? ",Stanford,2018

Congratulations to all of you who were accepted, you guys will do great things at Stanford! I'm not disappointed by the decision, actually, despite waiting in anticipation. Especially after reading the letter that they sent to us who were rejected, I really don't feel so bad. And for all of you who were rejected, remember one thing: Everything happens for a reason, and happens for the good. And one last thing: Don't give up, just keep moving forward. Please take the time to read the letter written by the Dean, it's inspirational. Congratulations once again to all of you who have been accepted to Stanford! ",Stanford,2018

General Comments:[/noparse]
I am VERY shocked that I got waitlisted, considering how many qualified people applied. I made a CC account just to post this and give people hope that normal people do in fact have a chance of attending a top college. If you were like me, you may have spent hours reading CC and got depressed at how many people with 2300+ SAT scores and countless ECs got rejected. Please take this advice to heart: DO NO JUDGE YOUR WORTH ON WHAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE DONE. They may have had more resources and easier environments growing up. Regardless though, always strive to do what you can in your given circumstances. You will get into a good college somewhere else, and at the end of the day, it is what you do with your time in college and not the college itself that allows you to succeed. Be honest in your application, especially in questions that ask you about your favorite things, because honesty is what really shines through an application and college padding and pretentiousness are easy to spot. Good luck to future applicants and remember to always try your best no matter what. ",Stanford,2018

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: No idea. I think it was the writing.

Particularly after the less than great news from Dartmouth and Brown yesterday, I wasn't expecting this one bit. I think it really goes to show you that each school is looking to fill a specific niche, and I fit Stanford's. Needless to say, I'm thrilled.

General Comments:
I hate to be cliche, but future applicants: don't ever give up! People told me I couldn't get in to any HYPSM school. My parents, some friends, and worst of all myself. And here I am with my dream school Stanford, and other great acceptances.
The odds were stacked against me: Asian... NJ... low GPA...sparse leadership positions...other great applicants from my school. But I just worked with what I had, put it all I had on the line, tried my hardest, and it paid off.
Also I'm sure it's the essays that helped me get in. I worked so hard on them, I would stay up late into the night trying new drafts and perfecting them.

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I think my internship and aquarium volunteer experience had a lot to do with it. Those are with pretty prestigious institutions.

General Comments: Can't wait to go! I still can't get over the shock and I never thought that this would really happen. Future Stanford applicants, start thinking about it early and strategically plan out your essays to cover lots different stuff and make yourself as interesting as possible. If it's your clear first choice, I recommend applying early as long as you can have your ducks in a row by October. That way, you'll be out of direct competition with fellow classmates at your school (assuming few others apply early) and if you are deferred you'll have a leg up on those who apply regular.

It doesn't matter what one does in life, as long as it benefits someone else and is driven from a passion for humanity. I was super transparent and didn't hold back my inner thoughts (9). I also submitted an optional update which emphasized my research and current activities, pretty much reinforcing what the Adcoms already knew

General Comments: Guys, dreams do come true. Thank you, College Confidential Community, for being such a support through the years. You are part of the reason I got into Stanford. To those who were denied admission, I totally empathize with you - all the ivies denied me too and I was so depressed with life, believing I had no chance at Stanford. During my time in limbo, I cried, mulled, and kept asking why why why why why....? And I realized that it ultimately wouldn't matter where I went, as long as I had a direction in my heart. Most of the world's most successful people like Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs didn't need the Ivies or Stanford to change the world, because they had the passion and drive to succeed, which is ultimately what is matters. And that starts with you. Of course I can't complain - Stanford is definitely a great platform and I am so humbled to have gotten in, but I also realize that my undergraduate education should not define me, even if that undergraduate education IS Stanford, one of the best schools in the world. So I guess in parting, rejects: don't get down on yourself; there is a full life ahead of you and once your make millions, it won't even matter where you went to college. Waitlist peeps: Keep your head up in case Stanford calls you, but be realistic at the same time so you go to college next year. Admits: Congrats! We made it! It's be a wonderful rollercoaster of a journey and I am so glad it's over. Time to change the world  (btw if you need help with essays, definitely check out chalky.co. They have real essays that worked!)
NB: I was deferred before but accepted now. It was really depressing at first but I realized it was an opportunity to really showcase myself (even though I got a fricken B first semester of senior year). But passion trumps everything - do what you love because you love it, not because colleges ""think"" it's cool.

Job/Work Experience: Paid Engineering Intern at Quip (http://quip.com). Moved up to SF, rented an apartment, and lived and worked on my own throughout the summer. Developed the core ""mentions"" feature of the Quip app, which allows you to link documents, users, and folders together in threads.
Volunteer/Community service: Organized after school tutoring weekly and developed an entire online tutoring system (part of the ""Whiteboard"" project), with a free National Honor Society tutor available in any subject.
Summer Activities: Summer Internship @ Quip and Living in San Francisco, Teaching Myself To Code, Developing Whiteboard and The Investing Academy
Essays:Common App - What drove me to develop Whiteboard and how originally it was a catastrophic failure, but how I grew and learned from it and turned it around years later. Honestly this one went through so many revisions that eventually it lost my voice and sounded generic. (6/10)Stanford Extracurricular: Explaining what Investing Academy was and how it grew to have worldwide impact, and how we used it on campus. This too lost my natural voice as I was trying to fit so much into 150 characters. (6/10)Stanford Intellectual Vitality: How I first learned to code, as it was pretty unconventional (no KhanAcademy or edX at the time). Described more my philosophy towards learning. It had some typos though, and may have come off as naive. (6/10)Stanford Future Roommate: How my desk and my notebook reflect who I am and how I think. This was my personal favorite. (8/10)Stanford ""What Matters?"": How, as an agnostic, I derive meaning in impact in change, and how that relates to everything I have done, especially in technology. Probably the best Stanford essay I did. (8/10)
Teacher Recommendations:APUSH Teacher - Most likely very good. He knew me the most personally and academically (got the academic award in his class, after all), and was also my MUN advisor, helping me increase membership 5x and take us to our first conference. He does write TONS of letters though, so theres a chance it was generic, and I wouldn't blame him though.Biology Teacher - Unsure, hope it was good! I didn't know her very personally, but was a top student in her class.
Counselor Rec: Should be pretty good! Didn't know each other very personally, but have been talking to her and getting advice since freshman year. Also did a lot of tech. stuff for the guidance office, and she wanted to write about the impact Whiteboard has had on our campus.
Additional Rec: Fantastic. From Bret Taylor, the CEO of Quip and Ex-CTO of Facebook (also, inventor of Google Maps). I got to know him pretty well over the summer, and he thought I was better than any college-level intern he's had at Facebook or Google. Also, being an alumni of the Stanford CS department always helps

General Comments: I found out yesterday, and the excitement has far from worn off (I'm finally calm enough to type this out though). After getting waitlisted by all the Ivy's I didn't even think this was a possibility. Stanford's been the dream for such a long time, and getting in is still surreal. My only advice would be to do what your passionate about - Stanford will notice. Also, spend as much time as possible on your essays, but don't freak out if you don't feel their not perfect. Mine where somewhat generic and even had a few typos, and I was freaking out the last three months thinking I blew it. As long as your essays convey who you are and what you want do in life, Stanford is within your reach.

I wish I could travel back in time and tell myself to snap out of my introverted shell and do stuff like get elected to the student council or join speech and debate, but now I only have the future to look forward to. Anyways, congrats to those admitted. ",Stanford,2018

Everyone has a chance, just apply to see what happens. For the ivies, make sure you spread yourself and do not apply to just a few schools, because they are so random.

General Comments: Stanford was my ""dream school."" Everyone thought I'd get in, but I knew better. I feel like other people are more disappointed than I am; I've made my peace. After receiving my early acceptance notice from USC, I gradually fell in love with the school. I'm confident that God has a purpose for me there, and I couldn't be happier to become a Trojan.

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: See weaknesses, besides doing REA I didn't really show interest. I was so confident that I was going before I got deferred, but after I kinda knew I wasn't going to make it. That deferral pool left me in the dust. They usually accept one from my school, not this year I guess.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Rejected: Olin, MIT, Yale-NUS, and UC Berkeley. Waitlisted: University of Michigan. Accepted: UC Merced, Wake Forest, UCLA, WUSTL, Columbia, Yale, and Harvard.General Comments: Stanford was my dream school since eighth grade. It was less so after I got deferred, but that was mostly out of spite. I got a likely letter from Columbia, and I started to question why it had been my favorite school in the first place. I came up with surprisingly few reasons. Still it would have been slim chances that I would deny it if I got accepted, so getting rejected did suck. I'm at a place where I don't want to see the word Stanford for another 3 months haha. There is good news in the rejection. I can probably do a better objective analysis of what college is right for me. Although this post is really depressing, I am very happy that I got accepted to some good schools, I even wrote Stanford's dean a non-sarcastic thank you email haha. I hope everyone enjoys whatever institution they received admittance to. Excluding UMich peeps, you suck for waitlisting me, I only logged into withdraw my damn application. Haha jk good luck everyone!

Decision: ACCEPTED!!!! 
Lol I never do these. This is simply to manifest the idea that you don’t need a 2400 SAT, ostentatious international awards, or pretentious extracurriculars to be accepted into a great school. Simply be yourself, and the true individual will shine through.
---OBJECTIVE---
SAT I: 2090 – 600 CR, 770 M, 720 W (11 Essay) from 3 sittings
ACT: never took it and don’t regret it
SAT II: 530 USH, 620 Spanish, 650 Physics, 770 Math II
Unweighted GPA: 4.0
Class Rank: 4/334
AP Scores: USH (2), English Lang (2), US Gov & Pol (3), Calc AB (4) – I didn’t send any of them
Senior Year Course Load: (all AP) – Bio, Lit, Spanish, Calc BC, and Psych + marching band
Major Awards: HAH. I didn’t win, nor have I ever HEARD of half of the stuff most of you have won. The only awards I put on the common app were the Junior Class Service Award, Academic Excellence (basically for showing up to school for four years and getting good grades), the President’s Education Awards Program (same idea), a citation for service on the Maryland Youth Advisory Council, and a Superior (1) Rating at the MD State Solo & Ensemble Festival for flute
---SUBJECTIVE---
Extracurriculars: I did a hell of a lot of stuff in school; unfortunately, the dreaded common app only offers place for 10 hahaha so these were the ones I found to be the most cohesive and “goal-oriented” – Rock n’ Roll Revival (9-12, musical production at my high school, it’s the biggest fundraiser we have and it annually brings in >$100,000), Symphonic and Marching Band (9-12, flute section leader, did AllShore and honors bands and what not), worked in my mom’s pediatric office for 3 yrs, Key Club (10-12, Awards Historian 10th grade, President 12th grade), National Honor Society, Mu Alpha Theta (10-12, President 12th grade), flute lessons with a university woodwind professor (11-12, I mentioned the International Flute Symposium I attended last summer at WVU), the Maryland Youth Advisory Council, Spanish Honor Society (10-12, President 12th grade)
Job/Work Experience: marching band basically is a job hahah but I kinda already mentioned the doctor’s office
Volunteer/Community Service: I was honestly terrified that this would be my demise. I only managed 270-300ish when most of my friends are up in the 600-800 range, with some up in the stratosphere (2000-3000s) I don’t even know how that’s humanly possible. I worked hard and was very active with Key Club and I really turned it around senior year. I think that, despite not having an astronomical amount of hours, really helped me.
Summer Activities: Jesus Christ you people are mighty specific! Other than working, pretty much the symposium and marching band (and ardently practicing the flute, of course ) But aside from that, I do actually have a life and I sleep until 3pm on weekdays and I stay out until 4am with my friends all weekend :-)
Essays: I was the proudest of my Stanford essays of all the colleges I applied to.
1.) Common App: Wrote the failure essay and talked about how being rejected from All State Band for 4 years really opened my eyes and made me realize that I am NOT the best flute player around, and that’s okay. I entitled it “All State Banned” and that was just pure gold; I pat myself on the back for that. (8/10)
2.) Extracurricular: wrote about marching band and the sense of unity cus everyone knows that we are a cult incognito haha (7/10)
3.) Intellectual Vitality: I wrote about a time when I was coming out of my lesson and I heard this kid playing “Twinkle Twinkle Litter Star” on violin and he kept missing one of the intervals. He kept going until he got it right, and it showed me that if he can persevere, then all of us can. (8/10)
4.) Letter to Roomate: This was the best essay by far. I really just spoke from the heart and tried to be funny. I talked about all my little quirks and how I’d probably be up at 3am watching the Berlin Philharmonic and how I’d never see my roommate because I’d always be in a practice room or a lab somewhere haha I also made sure to mention specific buildings on campus. One line was like “If you want to talk, we can always meet up at CoHo” one of the coffee shops on campus at Stanford. I also mad a reference to Jordan Hall (the building that houses the psychology department), so I think they really saw that I wanted the SCHOOL and not just the prestige. (169023/10 I’m sorry, I was just really really REALLY proud of this essay)
5.) What Matters: I talked about Spanish (and wrote it in Spanish, I really think that blew them away). I said it’s important that every person learn a second language in order to show others that you’re open to the challenge of learning a new culture. (9/10)
Recommendations: I got one from my AP Lang teacher to justify that I am a good writer and deserved a 5 on the exam. I got the other from my 10th grade English teacher. I went on a trip to Italy with her and 10ish other students last summer so she really got to know me on a personal level. The last was from my band director. I really only asked him because I’d known one person who graduated like 6 or 7 years ago whom he wrote a recc for and he got into Stanford. I DID read his and it was the most beautiful recommendation I’d ever seen (his was the additional recc that I personally mailed).
Couselor Recc: idk and idc
Interview: The closest ones were in DC so I didn't interview haha but I guess it doesn’t really matter since I got in anyways
---OTHER---
State: MD priddeeee!!!
Country: USA
School Type: public
Race: African American
Gender: male
Income bracket: $100,000-$120,000ish (they didn’t give me any financial aid) 
Hooks: I don’t like to say that my race is a “hook”, but I definitely think it played a role in the decision.
---REFLECTION---
Strengths: essays and character, I really didn’t care about numbers; the person who they were evaluating was a lot more important to me. I really tried to manifest that idea in the application.
Weaknesses: Good Lord, my test scores were a joke hahahahha and the community service was on the low side. “Lack of major awards” is not a weakness, fyi.
Why you think you were accepted: Honestly, who knows. The 5% that were accepted probably don’t have a clue. I just told myself to be myself and everything would work out okay. THAT and the fact that I’m a black Spanish speaking male flute player that wants to be a music therapist hahaha I guess that’s pretty unique.
Where else you were accepted:
Accepted: Brown, Cornell, Georgia Tech, Georgetown, Johns Hopkins, Northeastern, Oberlin College & Conservatory (flute performance woohoo!!), Salisbury University, Stanford, Syracuse, the University of Miami and the Frost School of Music, Virginia Tech, and a full ride to UMD College Park
Rejected: Peabody Conservatory of Music, and Harvard after SCEA deferral
General Comments: Honestly, you guys stress yourselves out WAAAYYYY too much. Getting on forums like these freaking out if your decision doesn’t come 17 seconds after the posted time? It’s a little ridiculous. I’m sure you’re all highly intelligent kids, much more than myself, but scores and grades are only a small portion of this. The admissions committee is a group of people who have emotions, not robots that throw away apps that have a <2200 SAT score. Do yourselves a favor, and just relax. To those who were accepted, I congratulate you on your accomplisments, and I cannot wait to meet you in the fall. To those that were waitlisted, if you got waitlisted from Stanford, you probably were accepted to some pretty nice places, so consider your great options! And to those of you who were rejected, it’s not the end of the world. Stanford is 1 of the hundreds of colleges in the US and the thousands in the entire world. You will find a place where you belong. ",Stanford,2018

Strengths: Passion, love, uniqueness
Weaknesses: Unorthodox schooling/education trajectory. Living in a small town (Less opportunity, had to create own activity)?
Why you think you were accepted/wait listed/rejected: Unusual schooling. Unusual application. I'm probably a little too different from the mainstream, even for Stanford. My head really does reside in an oscillation between a continuos streaming consciousness, as an unrecognizable form to most people (at least based on my understanding of ""most people's"" experience) and a state of human regularity.
Also, obviously the numbers make it a bit of a crap shoot, such that anything that could be viewed as a weakness is often used as an excuse to toss an application. This is perhaps the biggest weakness in the process, but I hope my rejection is not an error, and that there was a body of students who will bring greater happiness to the world that have been admitted. In some ways it is a relief, to know so many promising individuals exist that will save humanity from destruction and carry us to greater bliss. Takes some weight off my shoulders, indeed. I just hope nature hasn't been violated today. Well.. it appears it has: Police: 20 children among 26 victims of Connecticut school shooting - CNN.com . I am not one to call prophecies or interpret omens. I hope there is no relationship.

Reflection
Strengths: It think that my application showcased a lot of diversity, both among my interests, my activities, an what I could bring to the school. I submitted an art supplement as well and I thought it was pretty good, but I don't know what others submitted. Naturally being a URM helped me too probably. I also think that my essays contributed.
Weaknesses: My scores weren't the highest, and while I had solid extracurriculars there wasn't anything outstandingly amazing
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I think that my application screamed diversity, both in the URM sense and the academic sense. My major was also a bit interesting, not many people apply to Stanford planning to study architecture. In the end I'll never really know why, I mean I wasn't the most amazing applicant, but all I can do is be grateful.

Why you think you were accepted: Definitely because of my devotion to music, and I think conducting is a way to showcase both music sensitivity and leadership. Also I try to present my unique focus on language and the arts.
General Comments: I couldn't bring myself to open the email, and just stayed in bed for a good 30 minutes. The realization of acceptance comes and goes, and I'm still getting used to the idea- everything is such a frenzy and blur. All I know is I am extremely happy and excited for everything to come. Also, good luck to everybody; stay disciplined and determined, and sane, because in a few months, all of this will go away, and wherever you are, we'll all be able to start enjoying college life!

Essays:
Common App: 5/10 It was risky, and, evidently, it didn't pay off. When I say it's 5/10, I don't mean it was horrible -- I just mean that, in general, people who read it either loved it or hated it.
What Matters?: I wrote about my love for politics. I thought it turned out very well (9/10)
Roommate: Meh... (7/10)
Intellectual vitality: It had some amazing lines, but the thing as a whole was only decent (7.5-8/10)
Teacher Recommendation: Both should have been amazing.
Counselor Rec: Quite good. However, being from a large, underfunded public school with 1 councilor for every 600 students, it obviously couldn't possibly be as good as some students from other schools get (this rec was the only one I saw).
Additional Rec: One from the county Democratic Party chair. I didn't see it, but I'm pretty sure it was amazing.

Reflection
Strengths: I thought I had some amazing EC's. Nearly all of them had strong leadership and showed my political passions. Also, my ""What Matters"" essay was extremely strong, in my opinion.
Weaknesses: SAT score, school type (noncompetitive with few APs, and the few it offered often created schedule conflicts with one another), and possibly Common App Essay
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I honestly think my application had two competing parts. On one hand, I had extremely good EC's, while, on the other hand, my academic credentials were probably less than many Stanford applicants'. I mean, my academic credentials certainly aren't bad, but, being from an underfunded public school, there's really only so much you can do.
General Comments:
First of all, and most importantly, I want to applaud every single one of you who was admitted. I am sure each and every one of you absolutely deserved it, and, together, you will make one heck of an amazing Stanford Class of 2017.
I have absolutely no regrets whatsoever about the application process. Of course, I would have wished for a different ending to my Stanford admissions experience, but I am heartened that there are 725 who were accepted who are just as (and probably more) deserving of admission as I am. However, throughout high school, I really dedicated myself to what I love -- leadership and politics. I got involved in every way I could possibly imagine. As a freshman, I would have never imagined myself making cold calls for candidates and canvassing countless strangers' doors. I never would have imagined myself facilitating voter registration drives at my high school. I never would have imagined myself getting to vote for myself (on the ballot) for the first time I was ever able to legally vote. In other words, I was really able to find my passion in high school and I am a better person for it.
Once again, I have no regrets. To all of you who will be applying for future Stanford classes, I have this to say: chase your dreams, find your passions, and enjoy life. The college you end up will not define you; rather, it's the impact you leave on the world that does. ",Stanford,2022

General Comments:
A lot of people on this website put an extreme premium on SAT scores, which I disagree with. Your life should not be dedicated to taking some stupid test (I took it once). Instead, do activities that you enjoy, try to be as involved as possible, and don't try to be perfect. Many colleges don't want perfect people; they're boring.
I used this website a lot for research while a junior and this year, so feel free to ask me questions (although this is my first post, so I guess visitor messages only...). I'd be happy to help, but keep in mind that I probably don't know much more than you do.
P.S. Check out the Official Stanford SCEA 2017 Applicants' Discussion. It's INSANE. My personal favorite is post #1055 (on page 71). ",Stanford,2022

Volunteer/Community service: Went on a trip to Tijuana, Mexico every spring break to build houses for impoverished families. Rebuilding Oakland Together- helped refurbish a house in a poor area of Oakland.
Essays: Common App essay was about independence, I really thought it was great, along with my counselor. Vitality Essay: my favorite one, about the magnificence of the universe. Roommate: Strong, about getting to know people. What matters: Strong, about having respect for myself. Could have come across as unoriginal.
Teacher Recommendation: Didn't read them, but both from teachers that I knew well. I did very well in their respective classes.

Reflection
Strengths: Strong SAT I, Filmmaking made me unique, very strong common app and EC essays. Good supplements. Very good grades and heavy course load at a difficult school.
Weaknesses: The lack of buildings that my family donated to the school. No legacy. EC's weren't that impressive. I didn't invent a robot or a time machine.
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Just another White kid with good grades and SAT. I guess there wasn't enough to make me special. There were also 3 other kids from my school that applied early, all of them absolute all-stars.

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Unhooked, good, but not great applicant
General Comments: Oh Stanford, how you wound me. Couldn't even have offered me a deferral? I applied early to Stanford because I really, truly enjoy learning and I thought it was the right school for me. I didn't really have too much guidance, as no one at my school is especially high achieving or does anything other than drugs. So little did I know, applying early to Stanford might actually be WORSE than applying regular. I tried, I tried. ",Stanford,2022

Job/Work Experience: SEAP Internship (8 weeks, liquid crystal research, $3k stipend awarded)
Volunteer/Community service: Math Honor Society tutoring, 2 weeks volunteer at a laboratory (basically an unpaid internship/shadowing).
Essays: Probably too trivial what I talked about... common app essay about diversity (Indian food on an American holiday), intellectual vitality essay about DARPATech, roommate essay was me describing myself a bit/trying to be funny, what matters essay about happiness.
Teacher Recommendation: Should have been at least decent. One from math teacher of three years, another from English teacher that gave an A to two people last year (I was one of them).

General Comments:
I really wanted to go to Stanford because I was hoping to go back to California (where I lived until I was 11) and because of their relatively strong engineering programs. My perception of Ivy League institutions and similar schools is that they are generally pretentious so I liked Stanford because it seemed a bit more relaxed. I thought of Stanford as this absolutely wonderful place, but perhaps I was being a bit idealistic. In the first place, it's really far away from where I live, so traveling back and forth would be challenging. Plus, for me, paying some $59K/year ($34k/year more than UVA) might not have been worth the undergraduate prestige. That's a lot of money. Anyway, kind of bummed, but what are you gonna do.

General Comments:
I'm very disappointed and somewhat hurt. I can't think of any ways to improve my application between now and February; the only major disadvantage I have, my ethnicity, is something that I can't change. I thought a 2400, excellent grades, decent extracurriculars, and unique essays would be enough to get admissions officers to overlook the color of my skin. Guess not. Another point: for the past five years at my school, 3 members of the senior class (70-80 students) have been admitted to Stanford each year. This year, no one was admitted through REA. Including me, two were deferred, and the other two rejected. ",Stanford,2022

Email: [address]
Stanford ID:########
Dear [first name],
After careful consideration and a thorough review of your candidacy, we have deferred your application to our Regular Decision review period. Our philosophy is to defer only a small percentage of Restrictive Early Action applicants, and thus you are part of a highly select group of students whose applications will be reviewed again.
The reasons for deferring a Restrictive Early Action application vary, but in most cases we want to reassess your candidacy in the broader context of our entire applicant pool, or we want to see your first term senior year grades. Although we cannot predict the likelihood of gaining admission, in each of the past four years approximately fifteen percent of deferred candidates have been admitted.
Between now and the end of February, we invite you to submit online an Optional Update Form. Let us know about any new honors, awards or significant personal accomplishments. Do not submit additional letters of recommendation. When first term grades are available, ask your school to submit an updated transcript with the Common Application Midyear Report Form. Include your Stanford ID number, located at the top of this letter, in all correspondence with the admission office.
We appreciate the thoughtfulness and hard work you put into your application and acknowledge your strong interest in Stanford as a Restrictive Early Action applicant. You will receive a final decision at the end of March, 2013.
Sincerely,
[Signature]

Strengths: Grades, scores, recommendations, research experience, awards, possibly essays. Did a lot of ECs but did all pretty well, so not really sure if breadth of interests was a strength or weakness.
Weaknesses: Less community service than many kids; not sure if so many ECs was pro or con

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I never hesitated to be a nontraditional high school student and follow multiple passions without choosing one or two big ones which everybody seems to think is the key. Well roundedness is chill too. Probably the essays played a big role too, looking back I think they conveyed a strong sense of intellectual curiosity and desire to use knowledge for a greater good...so work your butts off on those.

Strengths: First generation, recommendations, community service, lots of good extra curriculars (I didn't write them all on here)
Weaknesses: Test scores, my school.
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I thought I was an okay candidate but what really killed me (as our principal explained) is that Stanford blacklisted our school for a year. Last year, only one student was accepted (he was also accepted to Yale and MIT) but instead chose to go to ASU. (I don't really understand it either.) What a school like STanford will do, is punish our school and administration for messing up their acceptance/attending rate by not accepting any students the following year. I'm not saying I would of gotten in otherwise but it definitely made my chances a lot worse. Or non-existent.

Taking it way better than I thought I would, because I’ve always been on the fence between Stanford and UCLA as my dream schools, and after getting rejected, I realized that UCLA probably has a much better fit for me than Stanford does. I’m glad the admissions officers were able to realize I wouldn’t fit in at Stanford before I realized it. [:
That being said, congratulations to everyone who got accepted! I’m sure you all will have a wonderful time at Stanford, and I’m truly happy for everyone who got in.
To those who were deferred, good luck! Three months will be over before you know it.
And to those rejected like me, please don’t be too upset about it. I’m sure all of you will find a college where you can happily pursue your dreams. After all, everyone says college is what YOU make of it, right? ",Stanford,2022

General Comments:
It’s disappointing to be deferred, guys. It really is. But I’m going to work my ass off in the next couple of months. I’ve already gotten a few new awards, joined academic UIL, qualified for All-State Band, signed up for the ACT/Math subject tests and my grades are very strong this year. Especially since Stanford only deferred 572 applicants, I know that I’m a qualified contender. Guys. I’M SO CLOSE (so are you other deferred applicants)!! I’m definitely not going to let this opportunity get away from me. I plan on being in Palo Alto in the fall.
This entire process seems crazy to me. I was scrolling through the thread and reading all of the stats of the rejected. I just can't fathom why some of them were rejected while I was let through to the next round. There has to be some element of randomness to all of this. Maybe. Meh. I don't know.

Additionally, there is no such thing as 4th place at USAMO or 12th place at Intel. OK, maybe you can figure out by the scores that you're 4th on USAMO. But if you're an Intel finalist and only that, it means you're 11-40th place. You don't get to find out which specific place you are. ",Stanford,2022

Unweighted GPA (out of 4.0): UK applicant, so n/a but GCSE’s were 11A*,AS Levels were 4 A’s in Maths, History, Philosophy and Chemistry, then an A* in Maths A level (did ‘further maths’ which basically ended up being maths a2 in a year, then running screaming from the actual further maths a level in y13)
Rank (percentile if rank is unavailable): UK applicant, so n/a but as a general guide, if you have straight A*’s at gcse, straight A’s at AS and straight A* predictions, you're gpa is 4.0 and you're basically #1 in your year (even though, I understand quite a few people tick two or more of these boxes and don’t necessarily get flooded with ucas offers, don’t let it bother you. In fact, even with the odd A or B, you’re still competitive for HYPSMC, it’s no biggie, they’re not looking for a brain in a jar, they want ‘leaders of the future’ and fulfilling THAT criteria is what you should be focussing on, not collecting meanignless qualifications )

But I repeat, in y12, just get your A’s and concentrate on the ‘subjectives.’ they are what will make you stand out.
Subjective:
Extracurriculars (place leadership in parenthesis):
elected member of youth parliament for my city,
voted regional debate leader,
made speech at the house of commons at the dispatch box and submitted the YouTube video of my speech as the ‘supplementary material’ thing to all the colleges that accepted extra stuff.
Other youth parliament things include attending council meetings, sitting on boards etc and in particular, negotiating with our bus companies to lower the fares for under 18s.
former member of our city’s youth council ,
founded and led something called ‘freedom of voice’ that I’ll talk about later.
Founder and captain of school debating society,
finalist at various comps eg oxford schools, European youth parl comp, Durham etc also was the first winner of the national chrystall public speaking prize from the north of England,
youth researcher for children in need (only a local project about social issues in highly diverse areas in city).
Did bronze, silver and gold duke of Edinburgh awards,
head of marketing in young enterprise (School business team)
played netball since y4, repped school and county,
got coaching and umpiring qualifications and got nominated for this leadership programme though netball.
Head of 6th form events committee,
house captain, and euphonium
grade 5 practical and theory (ABRSM) but didn’t play for any bands or anything, and yeah, alter served at church for about 10yrs (ish)
Job/Work Experience: part time job supervising homework club at school (basically free money to sit there and do your homework)
work shadowed local mp at Westminster and local member of European parliament in Brussels.
Shadowed a number of barristers at Hardwicke chambers in London (absolutely recommend here if you’re struggling to find legal work exp due to the absolute endemic of nepotism in the bar)
got invited to watch this case in Manchester with a truly phenomenal QC at Kings Chambers
Volunteer/Community service: overlaps with ECs, although I will say, don’t list things that don’t contribute to a focused profile of you. Eg I volunteered at the children hospital in our city on and off, even did quite a bit of medical work exp but cos I later decided I didn’t want to be a doctor, I didn’t put ANY of it onto my comm App
Summer Activities: debate academy, young leaders camp (netball), various uni taster courses and stuff with youth parliament
Essays: comm. App essay about how my dad’s childhood experience of being a refugee in the Nigerian civil war led me to founding Freedom of voice (UK’s first youth led conversation club [teaches English to asylum seeker/refugee young people in the city]) project got cut by the coalition, but if any English people here can find the funding to pick that up, be my guest (and let me know obvs).
Supplement essay:The thing about your intellectual development was like the first paragraph of my ucas personal statement, i.e. very dull and contrite. what matters to you and why was about girly *****iness and why retaliation is bad (but not in the overtly simplistic tone i'm using now obvs) and the letter 2 the roomate was just a comedic list of my bad habits ( a very much censored version of my first draft which was riddled with 50 shade of grey jokes). the stanford sup was by FAR my favourtie. i absolutely loved writing them cos there was so much room for ****-takes. best thing ever
Teacher Recommendation: begged my head of year not to send my ucas ones (I’d seen it already and it was insanely generic) but of course he sent it anyway. When I found out (in mid January) I showed him (again) the samples on the Fulbright commission and MIT websites and they revised them. Best bit of recs were probs the maths one where it noted that I didn’t find maths easy and was in a particularly able class of further maths students (my school actually has geniuses there…) but persevered anyway. Always a plus if you can get a good rec from a subject that doesn’t come naturally to you
Counselor Rec: same thing, sent generic ones then more personal corrective statement later on. The reason my recs were influential is cos they didn’t just list superlatives (i.e. ucas reference) it DESCRIBED why I was ‘x’ superlative. Far more convincing
Additional Rec: I sent one from a youth parliament supervisor (because I suspected my school ones wouldn’t be descriptive enough) and he did awesome. Basically talked about the socio-economic diversity within youth parliament, and how I’m good at getting on with a range of ages, backgrounds etc. talked about me taking initiative, being a leadership figure etc. It’s always important to ONLY send additional recs if they can bring something NEW to your app.
Interview: with a nice lady, she was a laugh and the convo was really realxed. even asked her what the party scene was like at stanford. unfortunately, her choice of words was 'tame..' but in fairness, she was a transfer student from loughborough so that is fairly hard to beat party wise.

Reflection
Strengths:
Comm. App essay told ‘that story only I could tell’ and was written in ‘my voice’ i.e. without silly descriptive words or long sentences. supplement, espesh the roomate letter was just hilarious imo, (but of course, the first draft was better  )
grades were faultless (which I hasten to add is not uncommon among top brit applicants so you’d best take extra subjects if you want to stand out)
ECs were the sorts I could guarantee no-one else had done, i.e. freedom of voice was a national first, and speaking at the House of Comms, is fairly unique
Weaknesses: I refuse to put that my SATs were ‘weaknesses.’ once you break the 700/700/700 barrier, they stop mattering. So do NOT stress about them.
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: essays. espesh since stanford's known for having very very slightly lower average sat scores whilst still being comparable to HYP, this is cos, imo, they rate the ability to express yourself especialy highly, hence why the supplement is so long
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Accepted: Princeton, Yale, Columbia (Kluge Scholar), Brown, Dartmouth and Cornell. Also offers from Durham (PPE), Warwick (PPE) and UCL(Philosophy and Economics). Waitlisted: nowhere thankfully. Rejected: Harvad, LSE, and Oxford (without an interview...the bastards. AND they had the balls to tell me I wasn’t ‘academically suited’ to their oh so rigorous degree programme. Moral of the story? You need a combined average of 65/99 in the TSA or more to have even a glimmer of a shot at PPE at oxford. Bastards. btw i'm not as bitter as i sound. i'm sure oxford is a wonderful university)
General Comments:
This forum, as well as giving me literally the most invaluable pointers during this unfamiliar application process, mostly made an impact by filling me with misery, anxiety and immense feelings of inferiority. The amount of bragging that goes on in this forum is just horrendous and at times I really did want to give up on applying cos, judging by what certain people said to others about their ‘stats’ etc, I thought I didn’t have a chance. The only reason why I’m posting on the decision thread is because these are by far the most helpful and I don’t think there is nearly enough free help for british applicants. I know it’s only a minority who use cc to brag and belittle others but it really really hurts. And as for those who’ve been helpful, hopefully this has been as helpful as you’ve been to me. Any further questions from British applicants, feel free to message me somehow (I’ve not quite got round to seeing how that works, so I may take a while replying). ",Stanford,2022

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I guess I was accepted because of being FTM and passion in photography; I suppose that made me stand out a little? And I did a sport too for four years?
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: REJECTED: Rice, Duke, Harvard, Yale, Brown, Dartmouth. ACCEPTED: UT Austin, UT Dallas

General Comments:
Looking back, Im proud of what Ive accomplished in high school. Yet Ive also been inspired by the absolutely amazing accomplishments of many other high school students that I know and have read about on College Confidential. Ive learned a lot from the whole college admissions process. But all I really have to say is stay confident and true to yourself and do things you care about, and not just things that will make your Common App look that much cooler. Just being a part of the elite group of students who have the slightest chance at Stanford or Ivies or other top universities should be something that youre proud of.  Good luck younger students and congratulations everyone!!!! ",Stanford,2022

It's going to come down to money. I'd much rather go to Harvey Mudd, actually, because I feel like the school suits me much better. Stanford seems a bit intimidating in personality. I'm very humbled that I got in, but my reaction was more confused than ecstatic.
For those who want to apply to Stanford: please do, but realize weird things happen in the admit room, and accomplished people will be rejected, while uninteresting people like me somehow get in. I'm honored, yes. But I understand that I haven't accomplished anything that would get me into this institution.

Essays (rating 1-10, details): My essays were not amazing. My common app ones were esoteric and a bit random. Honestly reading them over now, they were rather shallow and expressed the typical themes of a high senior i.e. becoming independent, following my dreams etc... Essay writing has never been my strong suit. Stanford is my dream school however, so I did spend the most time on the supplements, by which I mean 3 days... My best and most creative essay by far was my Uchic one, but I expressed my deepest feelings and hopes in my Stanford ones and probably looked the most real in them.

Counselor Rec: She thinks I'm not the brightest person in the world... Can't argue with her there 
Additional Rec: Had my research mentor who was never there write me one. I hated him because he abandoned me to figure out how to operate a dozen machines by myself until the day before my project was due and when he wasn't busy and tried to help ended up ruining one of my test wafers. He knew that though and we had a respectful relationship between each other. Yeah lots of angst about this, lol. He knew I worked my butt off though, did grad level work and stayed over time and worked on weekends to finish my project. Hopefully he wrote about it.

Rejected: Harvard, MIT
General Comments: Now onto my advice, whether it be useful or not, who knows. There's no way to guarantee admission into a school, but I've noticed a MUCH better success rate in my schools where I did this than those in which I didn’t. Then again, this also correlated with how much I cared about getting into the school most of the time. You need to convince the school that you have the mindset of one of their students. For Stanford, there's a random website you can google up that describes a Stanford student. Ambitious, innovative, chill etc... While this a stereotype and people there are all very different, these common factors are what I would look for if I were in admissions. Given that I'm not an expert in this, do this at your own risk.
For Stanford I addressed their prompts, but in them I showed the admissions offices that I could have fun and wasn't a workaholic, that I was very driven and ambitious and had a goal to help others, that I took my opportunities seriously and strove to turn the smallest things into something big. Don’t turn your essays into one big brag fest, which I know, every admissions site says, but we all seem to end up doing. You have an underlying theme under each essay, but you need to tell admissions why this matters. This theme matters because you have the personalities of a (insert college name) student. My essays were very simple and straightforward, a bit quirky and unique to be remembered and my ideas were VERY clearly conveyed. I tried to cross out every characteristic the website gave and that is what I feel gave me the best odds of getting in. I was very cerebral for Uchic and demonstrated my love for philosophy and strive to learn even when barriers faced my way through the medium of Waldo (though I think Uchic let me in more for my 1600 and 4.0 than anything else because I told them I was an engineering major which should have been a big hint that I didn’t know anything about the school back then). . I did the same for Columbia (although I also wrote the worst essays of my life in the 5 hours I gave myself to finish their supplement OTL) and emphasized how important learning was to me and that I sought to be well rounded. I didn’t use Princeton’s helping the nation prompt, but I focused on my goals of helping others. I never even read MIT’s desired student type and look what happened, lol. This seems like common sense, but for me, I didn’t know what I was doing while writing these essays till after EA apps were submitted. Hope you guys learn from my mistakes. Finally what’s most important is that you don’t try to lie to admissions about the type of person that you are. I really do enjoy learning, really am ambitious, really am weird and that’s what made my essays sound honest. If you don’t have the characteristics of one of the students that go to this school, you really shouldn’t be applying.
Pheww longwinded comment. Hope this helps someone in the future though and don’t take any of the exaggerated bragging that people do on here seriously. We all feel inferior after reading it lol and yes normal people like me can get in. ",Stanford,2022

Essays (rating 1-10, details): 10, I think that these got me in the school. These essays were my pride and joy. I recycled some of these essays for my Kenyon app and they wrote me a letter saying my essays were among the best they've read all year, which was a really good sign for me.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): My English teacher's rec was probably superb, and my Math teacher's rec was probably generic.

Teacher Rec #2: Like, 5 or 6?
Counselor Rec: Better than usual. I fought with him over everything (like taking certain courses I didn't meet the requirements for) and basically drove him crazy, but in the end he came to really respect me and wrote a ton in my rec.
Additional Rec:

Interview: I actually had one because my dad knew a former admissions officer. It wasn't really an interview, just a time for me to ask questions about Stanford.

Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): 5 time legacy, grandfather taught at Stanford.
Reflection
Strengths: 5 time legacy, ESSAYS.
Weaknesses: GPA, AP scores?
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I'm not sure exactly. I know that Stanford puts all legacies in one pile and accepts a certain amount from the pile. I think that being a 5-time legacy had a lot of weight, but my college counselor says that she's seen people in my situation get rejected many times in the past 10 years with stronger SAT scores and GPA. So maybe my essays? I don't know! I feel guilty about it.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Accepted to Carleton, Kenyon, Whitman, Pitzer, and some other places. Rejected at Wash U, Brown, Bowdoin, Rice, and Wesleyan.
General Comments: I noticed that the schools that accepted me were the ones that I recycled Stanford's essays for, and the schools that rejected me (aka my reach schools) were ones that either didn't require an essay or I didn't write very good essays for. So I think that my acceptance was based on a mixture of essays and legacy status. Stanford is a dream come true, and after everything I've been through personally in these past six years, it is just the light at the end of the tunnel. I'm going to make something of my education because I know I can't let this opportunity go to waste. Congrats to you all, regardless of admission decision -- the fact that you survived first semester senior year and even applied to Stanford in the first place just shows you how smart you are.

(i mean that very secularly.) stanford is the one school i applied to that i haven't visited yet but i am hyped to be fleeing the minnesotan cold for california!! (also i hear the education is pretty good but whatever that's for nerds amirite amirite??)
but again, who knows why i was accepted here and denied elsewhere - stanford had the lowest acceptance rate of all of the top schools this year, yet i was shut down by most other comparable institutions. last year, i made it to the interview round for TASP, but then was not chosen for the program. (i know that might not be all that relevant but it still smarts, okay??)
to me, the lesson here is that if you lay it all f***ing out there (can i swear here?? please??) and be true to who you are and put your talent to good use, someone important will notice.

(7) My intellectual vitality was about how my Google history showcases my curiosity (8). My roommate letter was a tour around my room and how it shows the kind of person I am (6). What matters to you is how I never read the first page of a book because for me, the 'beginnings' don't matter. I LOVED this essay.

Essays (rating 1-10, details): 10; I worked really hard on it and it wows everyone who reads it, even English professors. Its about the above-mentioned healthcare program.
Supplements: 9; The intellectual vitality one was about how I taught myself to play a hard piano piece as a complete beginner; my response to the roommate question was a unique, list-like essay about my idiosyncrasies; for the last essay, I said happiness is everything in life and everyone has the right to pursue it his or her own way. Just for fun, I should mention I risked using the word YOLO in my first essay. I guess it worked.
Recommendations:
Teacher recommendations should have been good. I knew both the teachers well and was a good student.
Counselor Rec: Certainly above average. I have a good relationship with my counselor. It was a couple pages long and really nice.

General Comments:
ON STANFORD
I knew when applying that whatever the Stanfords decision would be, it would be a surprise. Like everyone says, college admissions are a complete crapshoot. Ive read these forums before; many of those who are turned down are highly accomplished and seemingly qualified. I am really grateful to be accepted to Stanford.
ON COLLEGE CONFIDENTIAL
Thanks to everyone here at College Confidential for sharing their experiences and advice. This website really pushed me to accomplish things I didnt know were within my reach. Ive spent hours hereusually moping about how Ill ever be able to compete with so many over-achievers. Thank you to everyone for being such an inspiration.
FINALLY
Congrats to Stanfords class of 2017 and to every college applicant this year! In America, we have the opportunity to define our own educations no matter where we attend. The doors are open here for anyone who is motivated to pursue success. The journey has just begun  ",Stanford,2022

I remember going through this experience 4 years ago and getting my admission from Stanford. It was an humbling day to be sure.
For all of you admitted, congratulations! Should you choose to accept, you have a very challenging four years ahead of you.
For those of you not, congratulations! Stanford is a huge bubble but more importantly, you are done with the admissions process, done stressing about the wait, and done worrying (hopefully). Your life will be awesome and this is only one moment in what I am sure will be an exciting college experience ahead of you. ",Stanford,2022

To those who were accepted and had music as an extra curricular activity.
Could you please tell me if submitting an arts supplement helps ?
If you are good at music and don't submit an arts supplement, is that considered a minus or will they read your essay and be impressed ? Please let me know. ",Stanford,2022

My orchestra class was just something I did because I had always done it--started in 4th grade, and just went to the classes. I didn't do solo ensemble, didn't perform anywhere else outside of school-mandated activities. I am horrible at the violin. Obviously, I didn't submit a supplement.
I think if you're already in music, you should continue (unless it makes you miserable... then quit). But don't go out of your way to learn an instrument just to pad your resume.
Also, none of my essays were on music. ",Stanford,2022
729,"
I agree with Mascara. Even if you put music as an ec, you don't necessarily have to submit a supplement. ",Stanford,2022
730,"
I had music as an EC but definitely did NOT submit a supplement lol  ",Stanford,2022
731,"
I'm sorry if I didn't make it clear.
Did you write an essay on music as an extracurricular and not submit the art supplement ?
Hope that makes it clear. ",Stanford,2022
732,"
Does it help in a significant way if you do submit an art supplement? :> I could probably practice a nice solo over the summer to use. ",Stanford,2022
733,"
My son submitted an art supplement (music) to all colleges he applied to except for Caltech, and he got into most of them including Stanford and Caltech. He had very strong stats and ECs anyway, but we didn't want to risk it. Remember though, that if you submit an art supplement to Stanford, the deadlines are a month earlier. Regular deadline is December 1st. They have very specific instructions which I recommend following precisely. For example, a recording cannot be edited. We made a nearly professional recording because our friends had good equipment. ",Stanford,2022

[size=+2]Decision: Accepted[/size]Objective:
SAT I (breakdown): 2280, 770 Math, 720 Reading, 790 Writing

IB (place score in parenthesis):
Senior Year Course Load: AP Lit, AP Chemistry, Anatomy and Physiology, online course: EPGY M52B (multivariable integral calculus), gov and econ
Major Awards (USAMO, Intel etc.): National Merit Winner (for apps I just put semifinalist at the time), Eagle scout?, 1st in state FBLA Business Math, 4th in state FBLA personal finance. Those FBLA ones aren't really major, but they're what I put under awards on common app. I also put Governor's school for the sciences
Subjective:
Extracurriculars (place leadership in parenthesis): 4 yrs varsity soccer, BSA (Senior patrol leader), community service, FBLA, Mock Trial, National Honors society, National english honors society, National Beta Society, science club. The first 5 were by far the most important/time consuming, and that's reflected on my common app.
Job/Work Experience: none
Volunteer/Community service: I forget the details, but I think it's something like 250+ (mostly through BSA)
Summer Activities:
2011: NYLF on Medicine, FBLA national Conference
2012: Gov school for the sciences (very competitive- 10% acceptance)
Essays: They were pretty decent, although my best essay was for harvard (rejected). I wrote about community service/BSA in one essay and about tutoring+my love of math in another. I also posted one about my family and upbringing (very diverse) and all the counterbalancing influences on my life (liberal household living in conservative state etc.) and how it lead me to have a balanced mindset on most things in life. I'd rate them 8/10. I didn't spend too much time on them (I did them last second), but I'll talk down there of something good that I realized in hindsight.
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): I didn't read the recs but I hear they were pretty good. I got a math and a physics one, they were probably 9/10 recs though because both teachers thought I was like the greatest or one of the greatest students they had ever had.
Counselor Rec: I honestly have no idea. It was probably decent but not the best, like a 6 or a 7. I didn't really know my counselor that well, but I guess I knew her better than most.

Reflection
Strengths:essays were pretty good as I said. They didn't seem like my best essays ever though, which if you are going to write college essays they might as well be your best ever. Start early on them and take your time to revisit them. Don't view writing them as a chore but rather as something that you really want to do. In hindsight I realized that I had written about my academic passions: about how I love the elegance of mathematics and how I had a fascination with understanding the core principles of the universe, and since I'm majoring in physics that was good for me to do. make sure that in at least one of your essays you talk about your academic passions in some way. Also, being in a public school in TN helped probably a ton. I took advantage of nearly every academic opportunity- taking all the ap classes offered except ap studio art, and I pushed myself to go forward in math beyond everyone else in those public schools- I was never afraid and took calc bc as a sophmore. Only 1 other kid in that public school made 5s on all his aps. I recommend that you too get mostly 5s and 4s on aps otherwise maybe applying to stanford isn't the best idea, as ap classes are probably the best indicator of collegiate success. My test scores (sats/act) were good enough. once you're above 2150/33 It really doesn't matter what you get. I knew this so I wasn't worried about my standardized test scores. On your sat 2s though make sure you do really good. the 780 on math 2 was disappointing but that's because I procrastinated till the last second before studying- so don't do that. By contrast I literally learned about 60% of the physics SAT 2 content in the month prior- studying for a month- and completely knocked that test out of the park. I just used a princeton review book to teach me the material and a lot of paper/pens. good ecs are very important- pick a few and go all the way with them. I did boy scouts, varsity soccer (huge time, physical,mental commitment. 15 hours a week of solid practice/training for 10 months out of the year- by far the hardest thing about highschool for me), FBLA, and Mock Trial were my main ones, although we didn't go far in mock trial and I never won anything national with FBLA.
Weaknesses: counselor rec? Essays could have been better, but maybe a more natural/less edited approach ended up better? I'm honestly not sure- just write about a passion of yours somewhere in your apps. 780 on Math 2 is pretty bad (I think over 10% make an 800 in case you didn't know- it isn't as hard as the normal SAT math section to make an 800). only 7 aps, but then again that's all that was offered (except for studio art)
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Essays and luck. Even though I know my essays could have been better- they really do make all the difference- also the short answers on the supplement app were very important- just like the essays.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Accepted: UCLA, UCSB, UC berkeley Rejected: Harvard, MIT
General Comments: I got in to my #1 choice, so that's awesome. Initially it was MIT, but honestly I wasn't even sad or surprised I didn't get in. Over time I grew to love stanford even more- you too should be willing to change your own perceptions. Be a little bit realistic with your aps and realize that applying to stanford is a total crapshoot even with perfect applications. Just take it easy with your apps and apply early. Make sure you get your safety schools in. Also about 3 of my colleges did not get a complete app due to counseling mistakes- so make sure that doesn't happen to you. You're primary academic focus should be on AP/IB classes and 2-3 really good ECs+community service.
MOST OF ALL HAVE FUN and realize that worrying constantly over your apps will only make you feel bad and will actually probably make your apps worse. Just take it lightly and with an open mind ready and willing for failure!!!! I honestly was fully prepared to not get accepted to my reach schools and that is perfectly ok. Just get up and make a first draft of an essay.  ",Stanford,2022
