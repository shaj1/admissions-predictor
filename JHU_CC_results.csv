Why you think you were accepted/not accepted and general comments:
Strengths: Essays!! I believe my essays set me over the edge. They were heartfelt and really showed a different side. Potential Hook (Disability) and National achievements/presentations in four activities.
Weaknesses: Forgot to submit AP Scores and bad AP Scores in general, no SAT Subject Tests
Why you think you were accepted: I’m a relatively normal kid. I have accomplished stuff, but I haven’t founded nonprofits and won science fairs. I’ve just tried my best to be the best version of me as a friend and as a leader in my community, and I guess the admissions committee saw that in me and decided I would be a good fit for the Hopkins community.
Where else were you accepted/rejected/deferred: University of South Florida (accepted), George Mason (accepted)
Where else did you apply: UVA, Virginia Tech, Temple
Final Thoughts: I have been in denial for the past four months, expecting a rejection from JHU because I got intimidated by everyone’s stats on Reddit and College Confidential. I never believed I was outstanding enough for JHU, despite the fact that my teachers and friends all believed I would easily get in. When I opened that decision, I just bawled so hard because I was in disbelief and so happy. I’m so grateful that the admissions committee saw something in me and decided to admit me the class of 2024! ",JHU,2024

Ethnicity: Asian (Indian)
Gender: Female
Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): International applicant? But I'm Indian so I don't think it counts
Why you think you were accepted/not accepted and general comments:
Strengths: Essays!! I believe my essays demonstrated my identity– as much as is possible in 650+400 words!
Weaknesses: Forgot to submit SAT Subject Tests and I'm kind of a cliché species– international, Indian, pre-med...
Why you think you were accepted: Honestly have no idea, THIS WAS MY DREAM SCHOOL (FOR LIKE 7 YEARS) and god I'm so grateful
Where else were you accepted/rejected/deferred: This was my first decision that was released (one and done!)
Where else did you apply: Columbia, Duke, UPenn, NU, WashU, UCSD, Emory, UMich, UNC Chapel Hill, UWash, URochester
Final Thoughts: I have been in denial since I received my acceptance from JHU. Just believe in yourself, and present your true authentic self. To all the other Indian/brown/Asian kids out there, and everyone else– don't be pressured into going to some expensive counselor– I really never went– and try to make sure your essays aren't conversational– talk about what really matters to you. Make sure that while you showcase yourself as a multifaceted individual, you remain true to your roots, and that you present your thoughts clearly in an organized manner.
And always wish the best for those applying with you– three from my school ED'd, and two of us were accepted!! ",JHU,2024

- National science bowl / 1st place at regionals, biology focus, vice president

- Schoolnova, STEM classes taught at stony brook
- Quiz Bowl
- Self taught drawing with one minor contest award
* Job/Work Experience: N/A besides summer research
* Volunteer/Community service: assisted and shadowed at a medical clinic, unpaid
* Essays:
- Common App (6): blegh. I tried to write something about my discovery / transition from art to biology, and how biology was artistic to me, but ultimately I think though it was well written it suffered from too much revisioning and was disorganized.
- JHU Collaboration Supplemental (5): tried to connect a science olympiad experience to information exchange, and talked about how information exchange was my type of collaboration. The first half talking about info exchange was probably some of the best writing i've ever done and i'm extremely proud of it, but then I had to totally rush the second half about scioly and it was quite poop. Write your essays far far in advance guys.
* Teacher Recommendations:
- 9th grade bio teacher (9): although it was a really old teacher they really liked me, someone told me they saw the letter and it was good
- 11th grade AP chem teacher (7): I really have no idea since this teacher probably hated me to some extent, but she knew me extremely well in my extracurriculars and from what she's said afterward I think she wrote something good.
* Counselor Rec:
Counselor (6): I actually saw this one, it wasn't very outstanding, seemed rather cookie cutter but spoke a lot about how I was very talented and dedicated and all that
* External Rec:
My research mentor (6): I saw this one, it was also somewhat cookie cutter but did provide a perspective on me from the lab which probably helped. I think it was the letter coming from the mentor that probably helped more than the letter itself

Why you think you were accepted/not accepted and general comments:
Strengths: My resume and scores. I think I showed a lot of dedication and passion about my extracurriculars. Research might've been the biggest plus.
Weaknesses: Essays were probably the worst part, they were really blegh since I didn't have any interesting things to say about myself! No big major awards, just a lot of small ones. Somewhat generic recs. Probably also blended into a large population of applicants to JHU - female, asian, going into bio lol. Barely any community service
Why you think you were accepted: Activities and scores
Where else were you accepted/rejected/deferred: N/A
Where else did you apply: N/A
Final Thoughts: I feel I was a middling ED acceptance for JHU, I got in with faith in myself but not outstandingly, and I likely would've been stomped if I had done RD. I'm super hype tho since this was my top school!! I know lurking these results threads helped me a lot so hopefully this helps someone. Also please keep in mind - these threads skew towards the top percentage of applicants! I personally know that a couple of applicants I've seen from some past threads have also qualified for crazier schools from RD so don't feel like you have to totally line up with them to get in ",JHU,2024

Why you think you were accepted/not accepted and general comments: My extracurrilars are great. SAT scores a bit less. As I said english is not my first language/language of education and I am not in an american international high school so this whole application process + the SAT was new to me; I am not gonna lie I really hoped I would get at least waitlisted and I was very disappointed when my results came out. Still proud of myself for even going through this whole application process by myself and tbh this website helped me so much, it's all positive at the end of the day and I hope my post can help other people too.

My common app essay was really good in my opinion. I wrote about a tough childhood and my dad who was an alcoholic. I'd rate it a 9/10.

I'm pretty close with him and I'm sure his letter was a 10/10. My AP biology teacher wrote me a letter which I'm sure was also great, I'm pretty close with her as well. I'd rate her letter an 8/10.
Counselor Rec: I'm not very close with her but I'm her she wrote a great letter. Probably a 7/10

Extenuating Circumstances: not sure. Probably the fact that english isn't my first language/language of education, I pretty much taught myself to be honest.
Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): international student? I would've said URM but I read somewhere that affirmative action doesn't apply to us bc technically I'm not a minority where I'm from, not sure if that's true but that makes sense to me lol
Why you think you were accepted/not accepted and general comments: My extracurrilars are great. SAT scores a bit less. As I said english is not my first language/language of education and I am not in an american international high school so this whole application process + the SAT was new to me; I am not gonna lie I really hoped I would get at least waitlisted and I was very disappointed when my results came out. Still proud of myself for even going through this whole application process by myself and tbh this website helped me so much, it's all positive at the end of the day and I hope my post can help other people too.

Job/Work Experience: I was a paid math tutor but I don't think I put this on the application
Volunteer/Community service: Most of my stuff in the ECs lol
Summer Activities: Guggenheim, taught writing workshops, editorial intern, coached debate, etc
Essays (rating 1-10, details): Common App -- 9.5/10; a little sentimental, a little poetic, a little feminist, and a lot nerdy, so very me
JHU Supplement -- About not being great at art & working with kids at the Guggenheim. This was probably my favorite essay, and I used an iteration of it for several of my schools (with the original being ~600 words for Harvard and Princeton)
Recommendations (rating 1-10, details): The dean of one of my safeties said they both spoke to the fact that I was a “gifted writer,"" which is all I know for certain, but if I had to guess...
Teacher Rec #1: 10/10, APUSH teacher, honestly one of my favorite people ever. I used to talk with her all the time about politics & history because I thought she was super interesting, and she always used to tell me how much she loved my writing. She retired now & she's like my little second-wave feminist mom & I love her with my whole heart
Teacher Rec #2: 9.5/10, AP English teacher, she understood how deeply passionate I was about writing and our whole class was pretty much centered around language & identity and feminism, so she really knew how genuine my intellectual interests are because she saw me in my element.
Counselor Rec: 8.5/10, Doesn't really know me, but I was the only person from my school recognized by National Merit & I'm valedictorian and I gave him a brag sheet, so I hope that did the trick. I know he clipped in an excerpt from one of my APUSH papers that I was proud of & talked about my MIT award, but don't know much else.

[*]Strengths: Obviously really deep creative writing spike (with international ECs & national writing/research awards), GPA, ACT, AP scores, probably essays/teacher recommendations

Why you think you were accepted/not accepted and general comments:
Ummmm I hate to say it but probably legacy. There were 4 students in my class ranked above me who had perfect SAT scores who were rejected, with similar extracurriculars, and better class loads. I mean, I still think I'm perfectly qualified to attend, but there were students with serious labwork, 20+ ECE classes, national awards, and other ridiculous accomplishments who didn't make the cut while I did.

JHU Supplement (9/10) - Really liked this essay, talked about the team dynamic I learned to enjoy from my time on a research team at TCNJ
[*] Teacher Recommendations:
Physics 1 (9/10) - One of my teacher's favorites, had him for two years, known him for three, helped inspire me to pursue physics, coached some of my sports and sponsored my clubs, fooled around a bit during class senior year so that's why I put 9/10 and not 10/10 lol.

[/list]General Comments:
For younger kids in HS, the biggest thing is to get involved in your passion as early as possible. Colleges don’t want well rounded students, but rather a well rounded class. The most attracive candidates are ones that are exceptional at their passion of choice, whether it be a scientific field, an instrument, a sport, writing, etc. I wish I could have gotten involved in my passion of research earlier and maybe entered into some Intel and Siemens science fair competitions to set myself apart more. It’s a little unfair that students are expected to make up their minds so early, but that’s what they look for. For older kids, the college process is sporadic, and chances are if you’re still reading, you will go far not based on what college you end up at, but rather your character and desire to succeed. This site helped to reshape my perspective about the application process, so I hope I can give back a little. I remember staying up late at night reading through countless results threads like this one, and I’d reccomend not to do that; these threads aren’t healthy for someone’s state of mind. If anyone has any questions, feel free to message me. Good luck to all, and congrats to everyone who was accepted. ",JHU,2022

Going into the college process, I really thought my greatest strength would be my writing and character/personality, so when I wrote a kinda bland JHU essay and didn't get the opportunity to interview and show someone who I really was, I thought my chances were a little bleak. But because I was applying to BME, maybe they were not as focused on style and a shining personality, but more interested in the objective things like scores, research history, leadership, and service. I guess my view of the admissions process is not what it seems to be. Best to just go with the flow. ",JHU,2022

Why you think you were accepted/not accepted and general comments: I think I just wasn't quite what the school was looking for, to be honest. JHU was not my top school and it probably shows...I am interested in the sciences and am kinda a nerd (was proud about my subject test scores) but where my real passion lies, at the moment, is in Japanese. They liked me enough to put me on the waitlist but not quite enough to accept me. I'll do some more explaining about the college process as briefly as I can down below to helpfully keep the spirits high of those who were waitlisted like me or rejected.Where else have I been accepted: Accepted: Cornell University CAS via likely letter, UW-Madison. Waitlisted: Johns Hopkins. Rejected: Stanford, WashU St. Louis.
As you can see, my acceptances and rejections so far have been all over the place so far--I received a likely letter from Cornell (the school I would have least expected such a thing from), I was flat-out rejected from the less selective WUStL, and waitlisted at the most selective (between Cornell WashU, and JHU), Johns Hopkins. I think it just goes to show that every school has its own agenda and the process is not as predictable as we may think it to be. I'm elated to have been accepted to Cornell, as it's one of my top three. To those of you who may be feeling a little depressed right now: outcomes are unpredictable. You will get into the school that you're meant to go to and you will be fine. Every school is different; do not give up hope yet. Cornell is just the right school for me and I'm the right student for it (has a very long-running and extensive east asian studies department). Anyways, good luck and congrats to those accepted.

Partially qualifications, partially legacy. In terms of classes, scores, and extracurriculars, I'm qualified, and yet at least 5 students more qualified than me in my HS were waitlisted or rejected. So I've got to think legacy played a role in differentiating me from them in the admissions office.

Why you think you were accepted/not accepted and general comments:
I was so shocked!!!! I rewrote my entire personal statement two weeks before the deadline...and it came out waaay more genuine and fluid. I wrote about my identity (lesbian latinx) and how that affects what I want to do in life.
My first two years of hs were at a large public school, and I received a couple B+'s. I only took two AP classes in my entire hs career. I'm finishing at a different hs through a dual-degree program (still public school), and here I decided to get more involved. In spanish this is called ""poniendome las pilas.""
If anyone is reading this who wants to apply but doesn't think they have the scores/gpa/leadership...you're wrong! Apply. College admissions become about luck at some point during the process, and you deserve to choose the kind of education you receive.

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Getting accepted came as a huge shock to me -- i think JHU, in changing their supplement, is searching for people that want to go into the sciences but have a creative and artistic background, and i think the writing in my application really emphasized that.

SAT II (Type, Score): US History (770), Biology - Ecological (770), Math II (760). Molecular Bio seemed ridiculously hard during testing for some reason.
Unweighted GPA (out of 4.0): 3.93
AP (place score in parenthesis): Biology (5), Statistics (4), Physics II (4), US History (5). I plan to take more this year but only had one year to take AP's since my public school didn't offer them.
Senior Year Course Load: AP English, AP Chemistry, Musical Theatre/Select Choir (had to audition), AP Computer Science/Programming, Honors Spanish 400, Independent Science Research (doing it on using sonication to lyse cells and prepare cell-free systems), and Fitness

Fewer than 100 people of millions of users have it)
Subjective:
Extracurriculars (place leadership in parenthesis):
-Knowledge Bowl (Captain) since middle school, got third place for state competition twice and first place once.
-Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Nothing special and not super active in it. Athletics was probably my weakest part of the application since I had no awards and wasn't super dedicated, but I plan to join JHU's group.
-Singing. I took private lessons, auditioned into the select choir, and participated in a local contest but didn't get to award. Only did it grades 11 and 12 since my public school had no choir.
Job/Work Experience: Local Biotech Startup (Student Research Leader) grades 11 and 12 all year doing a ridiculous number of hours. Won a bronze prize against graduate students in an international genetic engineering competition doing work on a cell-free heavy metal biosensor.
Volunteer/Community service: Boy Scouts of America (Eagle Scout, Senior Patrol Leader multiple terms, OA Arrowman multiple years) since grade school. IDK how many hours total but it's a significant amount. Eagle Project alone was ~150.
Essays: ?/10. I went all or nothing with my essays and really went into my love for bioengineering, talking about how I've loved it from a young age and worked very hard to get my internship, emailing PI's out of nowhere and things like that, as well as all I've learned during my work at the biotech startup.
Teacher Recommendations:
-AP Physics 2 Teacher, Grade 11 - 9/10. An extremely nice teacher whose class I wasn't perfect in, but ended up jumping straight into without taking AP Physics 1. I had to ask him for help fairly often because of the added rigor trying to catch up to the other top students at the private school, so I think he got to know me a little better. I also worked on an extracurricular science project with him for a bit.
-AP Literature/Literature Teacher, Grades 11 and 12 - 6/10. She seemed to like me and think I was a good student, but I think our personalities didn't mesh extremely well and again, I don't know how many details she really could have included in her letter.
Counselor Rec: 7/10? He seemed to like me but we weren't super close and I don't know how many details he could have included. Private school counselor probably helped a lot though.

Why you think you were accepted/not accepted and general comments:
College results have been such an enigma to me, and it really shows how random the process can seem. I got into the University of Washington (without my declared major), and Boston University, but was waitlisted by Yale and Case Western, and denied by MIT, Harvard, Princeton, and Northwestern. The results have really confused me because Case Western seemed to be begging me to go but then waitlisted me, and UW didn't give me my desired major. But I got into JHU's BME? I was also feeling really, really strong about MIT since my interview went perfectly, but I didn't even do an interview for Hopkins and I thought my EC recommendations for other colleges were far stronger than my academic recommendations since I had my PI and Scoutmaster write them.
The only thing I can think of that really explains why I got the results I did is my essays. In the end, I chose to write about my passion for genetics and BME instead of going for a more well-rounded approach and trying to be funny, talk about a life lesson, or write about what I thought might make me more appealing to the universities and ""flesh out my character"" more. I reasoned that since it was what mattered to me, hopefully, it would help me get into a college that would actually fit me, so I'll have to see when I visit SOHOP in April if it worked or not. Although some of the rejections stung (I loved Boston, especially MIT and Harvard), I find myself wondering if JHU fits me more in the end since what I'm after is primarily academics and research (which JHU supplies in spades on both accounts), followed by meeting ambitious people, and as a far third extracurriculars/a good social scene, but that could just be me rationalizing.
I indicated a lot of interests at JHU if that helps, and it's my impression that Johns Hopkins really likes First Generation Students since they offer to aid you in flying out for SOHOP, so that may have helped too.
As a last note, is there anywhere other than SOHOP the JHU class of 2022 is congregating? I'd love to make connections with future classmates but searching around didn't turn up anything other than this website. ",JHU,2022

Summer Activities: translator for foreign patients at a hospital back home, intern for Penta (a nonprofit founded by Brown and Yale students)
Essays: 9/10. I wrote about how the Vietnam War was taught very different in Vietnam and the states. My supplement was about the initial struggles of building my nonprofit organization in Vietnam. I thought they were pretty good. The people I asked to read them really liked them as well. Apparently, the admission officer didn't.
Teacher Recommendation: 10/10 for the one from my US History teacher and 9/10 for the one from my AP Bio teacher

Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: Honestly idek. I thought they could look pass the low GPA since I did explain that I had to take multiple medical leaves throughout junior year, and founding my own nonprofit would make up for it. I really thought I would get in tbh.
General comments: On a lighter note, I got into Drexel this morning. Congrats to everyone who got in, and I'll see those who got rejected in the regular round. ",JHU,2022

Reflection
Strengths: definitely my writing and my recs. also my ecs were pretty decent and very cohesive. act score def a plug. i'm also a humanities major
Weaknesses: my gpa might look good, but i took 4 Bs my junior year, which is a big dip from my first two years. my sat iis are also sort of laughable, especially math.
Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: my writing for sure, and also my recs. i showed a lot of passion in my work (can be seen in ecs) and i tried very hard in school, even though i sucked at math and sciences. i have a very fun personality and i contribute in class, so i'm certain my teachers took note of that in my recs. my grades were good enough and my act score put me in the running, but i think what made the difference was everything else
General Comments: underclassmen: don't ever do an activity solely for college. it gives you a lot of unnecessary stress and it's a waste of your energy. find your passion, pursue it with all your energy, and everything will fall into place. i promise.
prospective applicants: i remember how stressed i was when i was in the application process. i know it's hard to stay calm and relaxed, but everything WILL be okay in the end. you've already made it so far — push through these months and everything will be smooth sailing  ",JHU,2022

Strengths: Test Scores, GPA, Reason for Pursuing Biology and Pre-Med
Weaknesses: No BME related experiences, No SAT II Science Scores
Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: I think I was accepted to JHU for the Biology Major because I conveyed that through my experiences as a volunteer/researcher as well as a patient with a chronic illness in the healthcare realm, I will try to become a difference-maker for those suffering with Crohn's and other inflammatory diseases. I was definitely rejected from BME for my weaknesses as stated above.
General Comments: I am really happy that I got into one of my top 5 choices. My main recommendation with applying to colleges and even JHU is to work the hardest and best you could REALISTICALLY do and then convey that same magnitude of your hard work in your essays. ",JHU,2021

Essays:
Personal Statement: 8/10 - I cried writing my essay. It was about challenging cultural beliefs and the rejection of my father. Talked about my immigrant, single-mother family home and the degrading beliefs of women in my family's culture and even in the American culture. Lots of feminist statements. My friends either hate it (it's too pitiful) or loved it (empowerment, boldening).
Supplement: 3/10 - Really cliche. Wrote about my dreams of becoming a cardiothoracic surgeon, undergrad research, why volunteering is necessary, and why people shouldn't look at money when deciding to go into the medical field to save lives.
Teacher Recommendation: I didn't read them but here's the relationship of my teachers
English: (3 years) She loves me for being a feminist. Before she wrote my recs, I also told her about the family issue that I wrote my personal statement on. When she read my essay, she basically was tearing up. Hard on me for having an ""accent"" so I stay after a lot to study with her. She tells me that my best characteristic is determinism and how determine I can become when I want something.
Math: (4 years) In addition to the rec request, I wrote about why he was my favorite teacher and how he inspires me to do more than what's given. I referenced how he indirectly helped me during the peaks of depression and how he encourages everyone in the class to be engaged in things people don't really consider interesting.
Counselor Rec: Whoops, I didn't ask her. I'm not sure if she wrote me one, but if she did, I do a bunch of stuff for the counselor's office.

Reflection:
Strengths: I poured my soul into that personal statement. I have a lot of volunteering opportunities and I did found the American Red Cross Campus Club at my school. I was really honest with the supplement essay because I didn't really have time to think about what others want, so I did what I do best and talked about spiritual growth and nonmaterialistic goals since I grew up as the poor kid.
Weaknesses: Literally wrote the supplement in five minutes before the deadline. I also messed up badly my freshmen year of high school. Probably could have gotten a better SAT score. Probably should not have procrastinated.
Why you think you were accepted: I honestly don't know, still in shock.

Reflection: I was completely myself in this application and didn't try to be someone I wasn't—and, it worked. I poured myself into research and didn't do a ton of clubs or have prestigious leadership positions. I also highly suggest reading Frank Bruni's ""Where You Go Is Not Who You'll Be."" I've spent a lot of time on this site, and while it has helped me immensely, I can't help but feel gross being on here at times, 'cause y'all can be really over the top. The school you go to will not determine your future; you're the one who does that. The most important thing you can do during high school is to try figuring out who you want to be and what your passions are. Don't try being someone else. Try not to get too caught up in this college admissions mania; just spend a hell of a lot of time on something you love, and you'll be fine. 
Strengths: Got semifinalist in a national science competition.
Weaknesses: I just wrote out my whole application, you be the judge

A lot of people stress over the process and read this website and it's just not healthy. Other people say stuff like, ""you'll find the school for you, it'll all work out"", and I don't think they're wrong--I just think they're obnoxious. You'll either have a relatively pain-free process and get into a school you really like, or you won't. But if your list includes schools you DON'T like, you'll end up disappointed. GW, for example, is a school I really, really, like. If every other school rejected me, and I ended up at GW, I would be thrilled. People who end up disappointed didn't pick their list right. You'll get into schools you shouldn't have gotten into based on your stats (like hopkins lol) and you'll get rejected from schools you should have gotten into. It's all about your mindset. ",JHU,2021

9/10 why JHU - Felt it was really genuine while at the same time something admissions want to see; I just feel I didn't get into specific details (courses, professors, etc.) as much as I could have.
Teacher Recommendation:
10/10 math (and peace) teacher; knows me well and thinks I am one of the best students to come along throughout his career.

For those of you who have hopkins as ur dream school,
it really isn't crazy difficult to do. 3 kids in my school all got in including me so as long as you apply early, you have a solid 30% chance as opposed to that ugly 10%
also early decision does round up alot of minorities, so if you're a minority you have a really solid chance, even if your test scores aren't crazy.
have faith in yourself!

Intern at Animal clinic one year
Another year I interned and participated in research at FIUs Biomedical Eng dept's Optical Imaging lab. The doctor I worked with actually spoke at hopkins on Nov 9, just days after the app was due so I'm sure that helped because she presented the research I alluded to on my application!!!
Essays: Common app was about coding. Basically it talked about how as a child I was passionate about becoming a doctor, and how through rigorous schooling and a monotonous learning env I lost sight of that passion. I described coding and discovering how to code saying that it really brought back that passion. I called it my transition to adulthood.
Supplement was weird. It talked about how as a child I was inquisitive enough to the point where it was annoying. I would constantly ask ""but why?"" And so I tied that into how research was important to me. I also talked about me being Vegan and all the vegan friendly options and clubs around hopkins. I talked about my love of animals and mentioned some clubs I I was interested in and mentioned BME too.
I also wrote in the additional info section, talking about the intricacies of my research experience and mentioning my mentor
Teacher Recommendation:
First was from my AP Bio teacher who is Buddhist and vegan and very much like myself. She always tells me I remind her of her daughter lol! And she treats me like one! she is amazing and she is the sponsor of my club Health Information Project... I run it on my own and she oversees most of the administration so she has a lot of respect for me in that regard.
The other was the Vice Principal!! She loves me and always comes to all my volleyball games and hugs me after and stuff! Such a nice lady and a very powerful one too!

General Comments: I think that my case supports the notion that you do not have to be POTUS or cure cancer to get accepted. I didn't have many activities, but they all defined me - someone who enjoys giving back, giving others a helping hand in life. Quantitative measures only take you so far - scores, numbers of leadership positions, etc. You need to have a general path, a backbone principle to your education that transcends what your eventual occupation may be, and you need to make this idea of what you want to do, and how it relates to your school, apparent.

Essays:
Common app was about my name and its unique nature. I tied it into my struggle to understand it growing up and how it related to me wanting to go into psychiatry in the future.
""Why Hopkins"" was about how my faith life is connected to the city of Baltimore, as well as how my name also plays a significant part there (provincial governor long ago had the last name that is now my first name)
Teacher Recommendation:
One was from my physics teacher and the other from my student council moderator, and I've known them both for a while so I'm sure they were good.

No, but seriously, try to get GOOD advice on the essays, and even read the examples that JHU provides from the previous years; I spent a week analyzing almost every essay in order to craft my JHU specific essay
For the recommendations, opt to NOT read them; it makes the recommendation seem more believable
Also, I did Chinese as my second language in school for 3 years, not 4
Finally, try to put as much emotion and truth into your JHU specific essays; JHU takes the essays seriously ",JHU,2020

Strengths: To be honest, I really didn't expect to be this successful in my college app process. Of course I had good stats, but I think the most important thing was my essays? I really can't tell you for a fact what set me apart, but I'm excited nonetheless!
Weaknesses: Definitely my ECs and even some of my stats. I mean they were good but I don't think they were exceptional. I really do think that JHU has a really holistic approach to reviewing the application.
Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: I couldn't tell you if I tried. Only the admissions officers know. Sorry, I know that's not very helpful, but hopefully the other information I've provided can help you discern anything else.
What would you have done differently?: I would've loved to have cool ECs like research or what not. But I mean it ended up working out so...

Honestly where I was at the beginning of my college application process versus now couldn't have been night and day. I never thought in a MILLION years I would be getting into the places I've gotten into, let alone JHU. I was literally considering not even applying because I never thought I would get in, so if you're someone who doesn't think you're good enough, the advice I would give you is just to try, because you never know what can happen!

(Copied from NEU thread again. Too lazy to type more) I had a lot of weird community service activities, including helping children in Vietnam, and a few Latin American countries. I didn't include all of them in my app, though. I had been doing community service WAY before HS and didn't want to fill up my activities with one event.
Essays (Include Subjects):
Common App Main:
9/10. It was personal, weird (the topic was a bit odd). Everyone that read it said it was amazing...but then again, everyone on CC raves about their essay. Opinions can be biased! I may THINK that my essay is a 9, but someone else might think it's a -1 or something.
JHU essay:Wrote my JHU supplement on the domestic house fly (I just say dung fly because it sounds cooler). Everyone who read it seemed to like it (but lol only my family read it hahah). I had a lot of fun writing this essay.

Recomendation: I wasn't TOO close to my teachers. I had only known them for less than 3 years. But I still had a good bond with them. I really liked all my teachers that I asked recs for, and I'm positive that they wrote a good one for me.

Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: I honestly have no idea.
Where else were you accepted/deferred/rejected: Deferred from Dartmouth. Accepted to Denison, Macalester, NEU (full tuition, Scholars program).
What would you have done differently?: Nothing, tbh. Although my parents say that I could've studied for the standardize tests a little more, I don't think I would've improved much. I wanted to concentrate on other things I was better at.
I poured everything I had into my essays. Every word, every sentence was genuine. And as for the ECs, those came more naturally. I don't really understand when people do things -- like help others or join clubs -- just to add them to their resumes. I mean, I guess it's because schools are getting so competitive these days...but still, it seems a little weird to pretend to care for something for a brief period of time and abandon it completely. Okay, I'm done with my rant. :
General Comments/Congratulations/Venting/Commiserations, etc: I honestly thought I would be rejected or waitlisted. My deferral from Dartmouth made me doubt myself a lot. And seeing all these really smart, brilliant people on CC made me feel like a dumbo. Maybe JHU made a mistake by accepting me. Or maybe it saw something in me that I couldn't. Who knows? Either way, I'm grateful.
Anyways, to those who were rejected or waitlisted: don't give up just yet. You may feel crushed and devastated, but things WILL get better. Every school looks for different types of students. One school might think you're not right. But another school might think the sun shines out of your butt. I've been stalking numerous threads on CC for a few months, and from what I've seen, all of you will do great things in the future.

Essays (Include Subjects):
Common App Main:
I took the *extremely* personal route with my Common App essay. I am the daughter of two amazing Turkish immigrants who moved here in their 30s. My family worked mainly blue-collar work; they never went to college, especially since the college admissions system in Turkey is extremely harsh. When I was six years old, my father passed away from a heart attack, and my life completely changed. My mother and I were left with virtually nothing, and we had to make a choice: stay here, for me, to get into college, or move back to Turkey. We roughed it through for several years while my mother found misc. employment, babysitting for 5 years until she received her legal status to find a steady job. Through experiencing this, I discovered my passion for medicine; I did not want anyone, regardless of who they were, to go through what I had to. My father's death could have been prevented, and I made it my goal to make sure no little girl would lose their daddy.
JHU essay:
I basically debunked the stereotype that science kids only want to study science. I talked about my interests in literature, and my passion for medicine. I actually quite liked my essay for JHU.

Recs: I never asked to read them, so I can't quite give a proper judgement. All teachers that took the time to write a recommendation for me are fantastic people who I have developed amazing relationships with.

Calc Teacher - I think he likes me, was also FBLA advisor, 8/10
Counselor Rec: Eh, she's new but I think she knew about me being queer/depressed so I think she emphasized that stuff, my course load is also probably on the most rigorous, 7/10
Additional Rec: Art Teacher - He's been doing this for 20+ years, tells me often about how he just knows I'll be super successful in the future, glowing 9/10
Interview: Didn't do
Other: I had art/music portfolios but JHU doesn't accept them.
State (if domestic applicant): CA
Country (if international applicant): N/A
Intended major(s): Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies; Philosophy
School Type: Public, ~2500 students. Bay Area, if that means anything. 70% Asian, practically a feeder school to the UCs/Stanford
Ethnicity: Asian (Chinese)
Gender: Female
Income Bracket: 200k+
Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): Practically none, LGBT+ maybe?
Reflection
Strengths: Scores, but being Asian they probably didn't help; focus on arts instead of STEM like most of my peers?
Weaknesses: Lack of leadership positions, not having an unweighted 4.0?, could've had better recs/presented myself better in the app
Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: I was so nervous, straight up shaking for a good hour during class before decisions. Congrats everyone who got accepted, and everyone else, you will end up where you're meant to be!
Where else were you accepted/deferred/rejected: Accepted - UC Davis (Regents), UC Irvine, UC San Diego, UC Santa Barbara (Regents), Bowdoin; waistlisted - WASHU; waiting on - CMU, Columbia, Dartmouth, Pomona, Rice, Vanderbilt, Vassar, Wesleyan, Williams, Yale, few more UCs (Berkeley, UCLA)
General Comments: Will be visiting in April and waiting for more decisions but JHU is one of my top choices! ",JHU,2020

What would you have done differently?: Writing a more personal essay, I believe mine was too generic but I guess it worked.General Comments/Congratulations/Venting/Commiserations, etc:

Really excited that I got in with the scholarship that I did. I was much more excited about applying to Hopkins during the first semester when I had my mind on going to a prestigious university, but when I got accepted to Clemson University's honors college with a full ride, it really made me put things into perspective. I definitely have a lot to think about in April. My only advice to applicants is to block this website from your computer. It's basically an anxiety attack that will never change the outcome of your application.

General Comments :
Please don't spend too much time on this website comparing yourself to other students. Not a single person here will be able to determine your acceptance, deferral, or rejection from a school, and the process truly is holistic. Unfortunately all you can do is submit your best application and wait until decisions come out, doing anything else will only stress you, and I know this from being a student who used to panic over reading the stats of other applicants.
I am excited to have been accepted and I can't wait to see what other options will appear in the next few months. ",JHU,2020

Essays (Include Subjects):
Common App Main: 10/10. When I was younger, my family was filthy rich, but my dad was arrested for Ponzi schemes when I was ~10. My mom and I (I'm an only child) became poor overnight: it was an incredibly sh*tty situation and I had to grow up really quickly. I also used this essay to explain how I first got interested in my proposed major (physics/astronomy): I used to sit on the roof of our home and look up at the stars, it was like an escape for me. Possibly one of the best pieces I've ever written. (We're doing ok now with help of friends and family, mother still unemployed tho, my grandparents have been paying for my schooling and stuff, we live in their house)
JHU essay: 9/10. Really awesome. Wrote about my experiences working at a hospital in Nepal and why I want to become a doctor
Other: Wrote a diversity piece (~300 words) on the extra section of the Common App to talk a bit about my heritage and family, I'm Choctaw

Teacher Recommendation #1: 8-9/10 science teacher. Told me I was one of the best students he'd ever taught but he's not a great writer. Also he sent it in like 15 mins before the deadline, pretty sure he wrote it the day it was due.
Teacher Recommendation #2: 7/10. Mandarin teacher. He really liked me and we were good friends, his class was one of my worst marks even though it was one of my most fun classes, but he showed me the letter and it was pretty poorly written. I tried to suggest some changes, dunno if he implemented them.
Counselor Rec: I would imagine 9/10, no idea what he wrote, I gave him my 'brag sheet' for ideas but idk
Additional Rec: 10/10, written by the head professor at the lab I work at, he's told me how much of a hard worker I am and he thinks it's great I'm taking his class at the university while in high school. Love that guy.

Weaknesses: Maybe test scores and not super mega impressive ECs
Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: I think I bring something unique
What would you have done differently?: I only wrote the ACT the one time, I probably should have taken it again but I didn't want to. Didn't seem to matter though!

[/list]Other Factors:I'm very excited I got in! Hopkins is definitely on the top of my list. I received an LL from Columbia and am still waiting on Ivy League and Stanford decisions, but even so I am definitely going to one of the Hopkins admit weekends before deciding. A close friend of my family's went there and I am so in love with the university. Go Blue Jays!

Essays:
[ *] Common App Main: Pretty good, I used the prompt everyone used and wrote about how I gained inspiration to write creatively and how my development into a more sociable person mirrored my development as a writer. Kind of cliche, but I think it came off as genuine and earnest.
[ *] JHU essay: Also pretty good, I put my three year school theater career through the the idea that I was ""picking up the cane"". This came from the fact that I've played old men in basically every theater production at my school at that point (from old ensemble man in Anyone Can Whistle to Feers in The Cherry Orchard) and many of these old men held canes. Basically picking up the cane is a metaphor for academic inquiry and creative risk and stuff since I ended getting really into acting and writing plays.
[ *] Teacher Recommendation #1: 9/10 Odd South African junior English teacher. He liked me a lot and he encouraged me to pursue writing and English.
Teacher Recommendation #2: 7/10 APUSH teacher, we had a good, if sarcastic, relationship and I did very well in his class.
[ *] Teacher Recommendation #3: 7/10 Precalculus teacher, I loved her and I had to go through a lot of academic growth in her class because it was fairly difficult to get an A.
(The reason I have a third rec is because a of a miscommunication between me and my teachers in which my math teacher sent her rec to Hopkins, blocking the rec of my English teacher which I wanted to send as Hopkins only allows two. I sent an email to the admissions office explaining the situation and they said they'd consider all three recs).
[ *] Counselor Rec: 10/10 She like me a lot and I often dropped by her office to talk or ask questions about whatever.
[ *] Interview: We met at a Dunkin Donuts. We ended talking a lot about movies for some reason. That's all I remember. 10/10 would interview again.

[ *] Weaknesses: I lacked in the extracurricular leadership department as I didn't really get involve in clubs and stuff until my sophomore/junior year due to my shyness.
[ *] Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: Since I'm going the humanities route, I wasn't the ""typical"" applicant since a lot of people see JHU as primarily a stem school. Also, I think my essays made up for my lack of leadership somewhat.

Essays (Include Subjects):
Common App Main: 7-8/10 I tried really hard to make it cool but it also didn’t exactly have the effect I wanted
JHU essay: 8/10 to be honest, I did the classic “copy-and-paste and replace with JHU,” the skeleton of the essay was a typical engineering essay but I made sure to add in some specifics about JHU that I thought were super cool

Teacher Recommendation #1: Naviance sort of messed up, so I don’t actually really know what recs went though (I had 3 recs total, but only 2 were sent…); 10/10 for my chemistry teacher, I’ve had him since freshman year and we also work together on a lot outside of school. My counselor said he blew it out of the water

General Comments/Congratulations/Venting/Commiserations, etc: Obviously it helps to have good scores and grades and everything that makes up a strong application, but in the end, the main determining factors are the weird little details that make you who you are and of course some luck. I have no way of knowing how I got in to JHU but not other equal-caliber schools, but to those of you who are hoping to get in next year, do as much research as you can to see what specifics you like about JHU, but always keep in mind that even the most seemingly perfect applicant might not get in. Congrats to everyone who got in! If you didn’t get in, don’t lose hope because you’re going to be at a college that in the end you will be able to shine the brightest  ",JHU,2020

Common App Essay: 8/10. I wrote about how I became our FBLA chapter's Webmaster after volunteering to update our newly-created website when nobody else would do so.
JHU essay: 9/10. It essentially had two parts; the first connected JHU's programs in Nanjing with myself and my heritage (Nanjing is my hometown); the second part connected my love for music (particularly K-pop) with the school's musical nature. This is probably the best ""Why X"" letter I've written.
Teacher Recommendation #1: 8/10 to 9/10. My AP English Lang teacher is an interesting person (he used to be an actor), so I'm sure he'd have an interesting perspective on me.
Teacher Recommendation #2: 7/10 to 8/10. My AP Physics B teacher knows me pretty well; however, he himself admits that he does not write the best letters.

Reflection
Strengths: (Perfect!) test scores and high grades were my definite strengths. I also like to attribute my success to the uniqueness of my ""Why JHU"" essay.
Weaknesses: A dearth of volunteer hours and a lack of an interview did not help. My ""average"" ECs and my ethnicity might be considered weaknesses as well.
Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: Part of me feels that JHU simply likes our school (given that it admitted multiple people this year and one last year), even if it's likely not the case. Otherwise, it's because of random chance and (possibly) my ""Why JHU"" essay.
What would you have done differently?: I wish I did less stuff, especially ECs, during high school; that way, I could've stressed myself out less and go for the favored ""depth over breadth"" approach.
General Comments: Congratulations to those who got in! (Especially to my fellow schoolmates who probably don't use CC). And for those who didn't, don't get down, because you're still awesome!

At the end of a day, if at these schools all that matter are freaking numbers to get in, instead of actually who the person behind those numbers are, then this is not a school I would like to go to. If I've learned anything from this is that ""prestigious"" schools just care about numbers and not the people just to continue their false marketing tactics. I'll just have to wait what happens, I'm happy I got Michigan, it's a school I really wanted although Vandy is my first. I know I shouldn't bet on getting in too much though. ",JHU,2020

National Merit Finalist, rank: 4/555. 3.94/4.0
GPA and 5.74/6 adjusted GPA (with APs); Public school,
Accepted into UT Austin Deans's Scholar, Plan 2 programs;
Accepted into Baylor, UT Dallas, UHouston with full ride and honors programs (will not join in any of these schools). Waiting on Brown, Vanderbilt, Stanford, UNC, RICE. Probably will get wait listed in couple again and may get admitted eventually into couple. Waiting mode and not stressed now with UTAustin in back pocket as she got into a top program, which should be good for Pre-med, as she will continue research which is mandatory under Dean's program at UT. State tution, close to Houston....If she gets admission at other school with some money then we will consider.
My yearly burden will be 23K and there is a good chance to get some money from UTAustin this fall or at least next year from Plan 2. My son got full tution (48k for 4 years) and books for his honors at ECE and plan 2 at UT Austin hwne he applied i 2014. . So there are hopes to get some money..good luck all.... ",JHU,2020

Extracurriculars (place leadership in parentheses):
- Step Team (Business Manager), step is a style of percussive dance for those that don't know. My team performs at a variety of school events such as pep rallies, talent shows, spirit days, basketball halftime shows, etc. We usually hold 3 practices a week from August - March. Takes up most of my time.
- Multicultural Club (Dance Group Leader), Multi is a club at my school that celebrates cultural diversity through dance. There are several cultural dance groups at my school and I'm a member of several of them. We spend the entire year practicing/rehearsing for an annual 2-day show held in the Spring of every year. In addition to being a member of several dance groups, I'm also the leader of one meaning I'm in charge of choreography, group management, organization, etc.
- Class Office (Historian)
- National History Honor Society (Secretary)
- Museum Teen Intern (Technically a volunteer program, not an internship)
- Summer Bridge (Admin/Group Leader), Help run week long programs during the summer that help incoming freshman adjust to a HS environment, my HS is notorious in the area for its different and rigorous academic environment (held twice a summer)
- Chinese Club
- Key Club
- CODE Club
- Various honor societies
In addition to these activities, I do a lot of programming on the side. I like to build websites, apps, etc. so I made sure to mention that in my additional comments section. I've also participated in programming competitions, wrote a comprehensive research paper on a specific family of pathfinding algorithms, and done freelance web development for small companies.
Job/Work Experience: None
Volunteer/Community service: 150+ hours
Writing (Write a brief description and Rate Quality on 1-10 Scale; 10 as Best):
Essays (Include Subjects):
Common App Main: 7-8/10, talked about a computer programming project I did as a junior that gained popularity in my school and on twitter. Talked about how it strengthened my love for CS, how it inspired me to try out new things, etc. I didn't think it was too great but when I talked to an admission counselor from another school I got accepted to, he said he really liked my essay and how it showed my personality and passion. I guess JHU recognized that too.
JHU essay: 8/10, I talked about my growing curiosity and passion for computer science, particularly artificial intelligence. I also talked about my interest in dance and how I'd love to continue this hobby/interest in college.

Teacher Recommendation #1: My computer science teacher, probably a 7/10. He uses a template for rec letters but he's had me for years and he told me he inserted a few things about me that deviated from his usual rec letters. Definitely a positive one though.
Teacher Recommendation #2: My IB history teacher, definitely an 8 or 9. She loved me when I was a sophomore and recognized that I'm great at computers but interested in other subjects too (like history). She also was a faculty sponsor for a school event I was a leader of so she's seen my leadership skills and what I'm capable of.
Counselor Rec: 9/10. My counselor was new this year so she didn't know me on a personal level. However, we talked about my resume and what I've accomplished over the years. We also discussed my personal background (low income, my family's path to America) and how she can talk about the adversity I've come across.

What would you have done differently?: Pursued more activities outside of school, like try for an internship related to my major
General Comments/Congratulations/Venting/Commiserations, etc: Very surprised I got in to be honest. But I'm happy. JHU is a great school and I'm thankful for the opportunity. I have to wait for a few other decisions and financial aid but it's nice having JHU as a potential option. ",JHU,2020

Essays (Include Subjects):
Common App Main: 9/10, about a memory condition I likely have (hyperthymesia, allows me to remember every day of the past four years in detail) and how it has influenced my interest in neuroscience and interdisciplinary studies. I changed the angle on this so many times but I think it turned out okay but the end, it was definitely original

Hooks
Recommendations:
Chem teacher: not sure, probably 8/10 (she and I got along really well and I think she had a good impression of me - never read the letter)
Music teacher 8.5/10 (I worked with him extensively on my composition and during my internship - briefly skimmed over the letter and it seemed positive)

State (if domestic applicant): Born in Washington DC
Country (if international applicant): Canada
School Type: Private school (one of the top in Canada)

Notes:
-My school is quite demanding and most universities take that into account when they look at marks
-I pursued music composition largely by myself without taking any lessons or theory courses - it was only in grade 10 that I began studying theory and working with teachers
-The reason I am not sure whether or not I have hyperthymesia is because I can't get diagnosed under the age of 18
Reflection
Strengths: Grades, essays/interests (I think my passion showed well), extracurricular involvement
Weaknesses: Lack of scientific extracurriculars
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I think it was the passion for what I did as well as my commitment to music.
Admitted: University of Toronto Neurosci, McGill Life Sci, Waterloo, Laurier, Johns Hopkins
Rejected: MIT, New England Conservatory
Waiting on: Yale (deferred ED) Harvard, Princeton, U of T Music, McGill Music, Peabody, Peabody/JHU double degree
I am SO excited to be accepted - I was preparing myself for rejection because everyone who applies is so talented. I won't deny that I'm a little nervous for double degree and Peabody results to come out now because I think I would love Hopkins and really want all the pieces of the puzzle to come together.

Reflection
Strengths: Took a Johns Hopkins CTY Online class in 6th grade after participating in their youth talent search program. Also submitted a resume which started with the CTY Online class and grew to show all my achievements and projects in the technology field. I then mentioned this growth in my essay and attributed it to JHU. I think this was my best strength. Additionally my job and leadership in the technology around me was helpful.
Weaknesses: Probably my SAT score and GPA. I got rejected by a lot of top colleges so I didn't think I'd get in.
Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: Really unexpected, I think it was the CTY course and Talent Search. Submitting my resume was probably an advantage.
What would you have done differently?: Studied more for the SAT.

What would you have done differently?: mainlY NOT PROCRASTINA3WRDED, taken the time to write better essays that reflect my personality more clearlyGeneral Comments/Congratulations/Venting/Commiserations, etc:
I SPENT SEVERal years of my life totally and utterly consumed by college admissions and, looking back, i genuinely believed that my self-worth was reliant on the level of prestige the name of my college held. college confidential definitely contributed to my anxiety, and at times it was poison. and i admit that part of the reason i'm here doing this now is to finally be the one on the other side, to claim that satisfaction of being one of the ""Accepted"" posts that i looked upon with envy for so many years. and it's great. i feel great rn. but mostly the reason i'm here is this: i want to say the things that i needed to hear years ago.
with a mindset like the one i had, it's so easy to be unhappy still. l'm upset that i didn't get into princeton or brown or columbia, and although i'm honestly overflowing with gratitude at being accepted to Johns Hopkins, it feels like there's no escaping the desire for more. and this is what i'm working on: finding confidence and faith elsewhere, being so grateful that i don't have time to wish for more than what life can give me right now, and, above all else, not taking myself or life too seriously.
the reality is that even if i didn't get into JHU, i'd be okay. because when it comes down to it, we never truly know what's going to happen. i could stumble upon a life-changing opportunity at jhu that wouldn't have been available had i been accepted to columbia. i never know what's going to happen, and i can only hope for the best while pursuing what i can. and i hope that--if anyone reading this is doing so with dread or fear or anxiety buzzing around in their minds--i can help in easing that pain at least 0.0001%. thERE IS MORE TO LIVE FOR AND THERE IS MORE TO LIFE

I was going to take 4 years of Chinese and 3 AP's for senior year, but at the start of second semester I had a schedule change to change Chinese 4 Honors to AP Macroeconomics so I will finish senior year with 3 years of Chinese and 4 AP's (9 total throughout high school). I suggest that you take 3 years of FL and 4 APs senior year if you REALLY don't want to do another year of that language. Also, I know that my name says UNC2020 but I made that name before I learned that I was accepted to JHU because I applied EA to UNC and RD to JHU. Also (lol), if you ever have a schedule change, REMEMBER to notify JHU of that schedule change; that's what I did.
*WARNING* I am a URM writing this so JHU may have ignored the extra year of Chinese in my case, and JHU only admits one student from my school a year and so this could have influenced my admission. ",JHU,2020

Comments: I never thought I could get in here! I found out in AP Gov and had to go outside to call my family. Try to be different than the rest of the pack at your school. Don’t do generic EC’s like Interact Club or Band, go out and join organizations outside your school. Go out and meet professionals and network like you’re a college student. Do things that interest you and that will have an impact on the world. And as always, get good test scores and a high class rank. ",JHU,2020

Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: Diversity of extracurriculars and ESSAYS! Put in all your effort into these. And make sure to get an interview, if you can talk very well with others this will pay off. My evaluation helped me in the admission process.
General Comments:
So ecstatic right now!! I feel blessed and also very lucky to be accepted by Johns Hopkins. Ever since, I visited campus this summer, it felt like a home to me and I conveyed this in my essays. If any questions, feel free to PM me. ",JHU,2020

Decision: Accepted
Accepted to JHU. Rejected from BME but that's totally OK. I was not expecting to get BME and only did it so that in the (slim) chance that I get into UChicago next week, I would be able to attend UChicago instead as they offer me more financial aid ahahah.

Volunteer/Community service: LOTS of tutoring, started from 9th grade. + helping with daily activities at the library for the past two summers
Summer Activities: see above
Essays: Not sure how to rate, but here goes.
8/10 - Common App (fairly risky. content was kinda meh but I wrote it in second person and I think it was quite compelling to read)
8/10 - JHU Supp (tried to keep it catchy, just talked about specific things about JHU like specific research opportunities & classes I'd love to take, also talked about participating in certain ECs at JHU. Also talked about how I wanted to go to Maryland for anime conventions...and I ended the essay with a pun relating to JHU).
Teacher Recommendation: no clue...pre-calc teacher probably talked about my struggle with math, how I got a 81 on the midterm but ended up getting a 96 on the final. USH teacher probably talked about my great writing skills (I'm good at writing analytical or humorous things. Just not personal essays!)

Weaknesses: lack of leadership in ECs, recs were probably generic as I'm introverted in class + fall asleep all the time...
Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: Mmmm I guess I was pretty strong as an applicant. I don't think anything would've necessarily hurt my app; I was either average or above average in each aspect.
General Comments: WHOO!!!!! IM SO HAPPY. I SCREAMED WHILE I WAS ON THE BUS AND STARTED CRYING. Glad my friend was there to comfort me. My first semester grades were going to be pretty crappy, so I'm so grateful that they don't matter much anymore. Congrats to everyone else who got in and good luck to everyone going through the regular decision process. Keeping up a decent GPA and writing awe-inspiring essays are the only things you can do at this point. My advice for essays is to make them ENTERTAINING. I believe that's what worked for me.

Strengths: Essays were very good. Also, my high school course load, GPA, class rank, and extracurriculars were very strong as well.
Weaknesses: Test scores for sure. Looking at the average SAT for JHU, the average SAT is apparently a 2110 (my score), however looking at everyone else on CC that applied on ED to JHU, my SAT was much lower. On top of that, I didn't even get above 700s on either the Math II or Physics SAT Subject Tests so I never submitted them, and I thought that would definitely hurt me.
Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected:
General Comments: I'm honestly still shocked that I actually got in. Reading some of these threads on CC got me to lose a bit of hope so I was really expecting the worst. Anyway, I am SO excited to be attending JHU next year!!!

Reflection
Strengths: SAT, GPA, being a double legacy, and I think I had an excellent CommonApp essay
Weaknesses: 3 on my Calc BC AP was disastrous, relatively few SAT IIs, and also no significant leadership roles and little community service
Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: They like legacies, and my application had a hook (my obsession with chess, which was the subject of the CommonApp essay). I imagine my recs were pretty good also.
General Comments:
Because people who didn't get in are much less likely to post on this thread, this thread only shows acceptances and is pretty misleading. But regardless, when I did an overnight visit to campus in September, I decided I really wanted to apply ED, and so I went on these forums and saw last year's version of this thread and was extremely intimidated. It seemed everyone who was getting in had much better stats than mine and even some of the people who didn't get in seemed much better qualified. And that's probably true this time around also- my stats and ECs still seem inferior to many who are getting in. I guess I'm not really one to talk, because I had a considerable advantage being a double legacy, but as a student trying to apply to these schools, you can't let yourself get put off or discouraged when you see these posts. I think it's much more about the intangibles than the scores; if you're applying to JHU you probably have the scores anyway. But the essays, the recs, the ECs, and the story you create with your application are the most important elements that separate students from one another, and so to anyone reading these posts in the future, don't let numbers intimidate you. It's a very selective school, and it's tough to get in no matter what, but focus on things that could make colleges interested in you and things you really love to do, and you can go far. ",JHU,2020

I'm incredibly happy and grateful to be a part of the class of 2020!!!! Go blu jays!
For future applicants: Don't be intimidated! Scores, numbers, and other facts are not as important as the inner you (wow I sound cheesy). Use the essay to your advantage, not to list your accomplishments but rather let out your own voice; the only way schools can know you is through the words you give them. True story: I woke up in a cold sweat 3 days before the ED deadline and completely scraped my essay because I realized it wasn't me, but instead a crappy compilation of ""achievements"" and ""success"". I replaced it with something simple: fish tanks. I used my life-long passion to bring out my ambitions, understandings, and maturity without sounding egotistical (or so I think haha). So to conclude what I've been trying to say: be yourself, let yourself, your ideas, values, and thoughts, show who you are, not high scores, numbers, or fancy achievements.
Good luck and I wish you all a wonderful day! ",JHU,2020

Essays: Not sure how to rate, but here goes.
8/10 - Common App (fairly risky. content was kinda meh but I wrote it in second person and I think it was quite compelling to read)
8/10 - JHU Supp (tried to keep it catchy, just talked about specific things about JHU like specific research opportunities & classes I'd love to take, also talked about participating in certain ECs at JHU. Also talked about how I wanted to go to Maryland for anime conventions...and I ended the essay with a pun relating to JHU).
Teacher Recommendation: no clue...pre-calc teacher probably talked about my struggle with math, how I got a 81 on the midterm but ended up getting a 96 on the final. USH teacher probably talked about my great writing skills (I'm good at writing analytical or humorous things. Just not personal essays!)

Weaknesses: Test scores for sure. Looking at the average SAT for JHU, the average SAT is apparently a 2110 (my score), however looking at everyone else on CC that applied on ED to JHU, my SAT was much lower. On top of that, I didn't even get above 700s on either the Math II or Physics SAT Subject Tests so I never submitted them, and I thought that would definitely hurt me.
Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected:
General Comments: I'm honestly still shocked that I actually got in. Reading some of these threads on CC got me to lose a bit of hope so I was really expecting the worst. Anyway, I am SO excited to be attending JHU next year!!!

Sailed most of my high school career for my school's sailing team, and was on varsity for one year. Math Team member all four years of high school. Model Congress member most of high school, and have participated in Model UN as well.
Job/Work Experience: none
Volunteer/Community service: only some events run out of my school (my school is very involved in community stuff)
Summer Activities: Did CTY for three summers (three weeks per summer) and took mostly philosophy classes (I love philosophy). Otherwise kept playing chess
Essays: Common App essay was probably very good, at least 9/10. JHU essay may have been a bit generic, I'll say 7.5/10
Teacher Recommendation: Probably both were good but I have no idea
Counselor Rec: Probably very good, especially compared to other schools. My school is very small so the admissions counselors know all the students very well and on a personal level
Additional Rec:
Interview: did not interview
Other
State (if domestic applicant): Maryland!
Country (if international applicant): USA
Intended major(s): Not sure, possibly international studies or economics
School Type: Very small private school (55 in my senior class)
Ethnicity: Caucasian
Gender: Male
Income Bracket: Probably upper
Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): Double legacy
Reflection
Strengths: SAT, GPA, being a double legacy, and I think I had an excellent CommonApp essay
Weaknesses: 3 on my Calc BC AP was disastrous, relatively few SAT IIs, and also no significant leadership roles and little community service
Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: They like legacies, and my application had a hook (my obsession with chess, which was the subject of the CommonApp essay). I imagine my recs were pretty good also.
General Comments:
Because people who didn't get in are much less likely to post on this thread, this thread only shows acceptances and is pretty misleading. But regardless, when I did an overnight visit to campus in September, I decided I really wanted to apply ED, and so I went on these forums and saw last year's version of this thread and was extremely intimidated. It seemed everyone who was getting in had much better stats than mine and even some of the people who didn't get in seemed much better qualified. And that's probably true this time around also- my stats and ECs still seem inferior to many who are getting in. I guess I'm not really one to talk, because I had a considerable advantage being a double legacy, but as a student trying to apply to these schools, you can't let yourself get put off or discouraged when you see these posts. I think it's much more about the intangibles than the scores; if you're applying to JHU you probably have the scores anyway. But the essays, the recs, the ECs, and the story you create with your application are the most important elements that separate students from one another, and so to anyone reading these posts in the future, don't let numbers intimidate you. It's a very selective school, and it's tough to get in no matter what, but focus on things that could make colleges interested in you and things you really love to do, and you can go far. ",JHU,2020

General Comments:
I'm incredibly happy and grateful to be a part of the class of 2020!!!! Go blu jays!
For future applicants: Don't be intimidated! Scores, numbers, and other facts are not as important as the inner you (wow I sound cheesy). Use the essay to your advantage, not to list your accomplishments but rather let out your own voice; the only way schools can know you is through the words you give them. True story: I woke up in a cold sweat 3 days before the ED deadline and completely scraped my essay because I realized it wasn't me, but instead a crappy compilation of ""achievements"" and ""success"". I replaced it with something simple: fish tanks. I used my life-long passion to bring out my ambitions, understandings, and maturity without sounding egotistical (or so I think haha). So to conclude what I've been trying to say: be yourself, let yourself, your ideas, values, and thoughts, show who you are, not high scores, numbers, or fancy achievements.
Good luck and I wish you all a wonderful day! ",JHU,2020

To anybody who thinks that they will not be accepted because they are not special and slightly below the cut 9 and I know that I stalked this forum form past years and was completely overwhelmed by the incredible applicants) - it is worth a try I mean look at me. Also, if you are a URM or first gen (or both) consider applying to the HOME program in the summer before your senior year it is a really great way to make sure that it is the perfect school for you, to meet people who may eventually be your classmates, and to really get a firm grasp on what to write your supplemental essays about ",JHU,2020

Objective:
SAT I (breakdown): n/a
ACT (breakdown): 34C (can't remember the individual scores tbh)
SAT II: 800 MII, 770 Chem
Unweighted GPA (out of 4.0): My school doesn't do GPA (or weighted grades/traditional ""Honors"" classes), but my raw grades were probably A- average (with B+'s and flat A's peppered throughout)
Rank (percentile if rank is unavailable): neither
AP (place score in parenthesis): Comp Sci (5). our school doesn't do AP courses either tbh; it is up to the student to self-register and self-study for the tests (but our college officers have supposedly sorted this out with the colleges themselves; hence, I don't consider this a total weakness). Planning to take English Lit, BC Calc, and Chemistry.
IB (place score in parenthesis): nope.
Senior Year Course Load: independent study in Algorithms, the equivalent of BC Calc, Advanced Chemistry, Multivariable Calc (our school staggers the curricula of the two Calc classes so math nuts can take both concurrently), English, US History
Major Awards (USAMO, Intel etc.): nope.
Common Awards (AP Scholar, honor roll, NM things, etc.): nah.
[ b]Subjective:[ /b]
Extracurriculars (name, grade levels, leadership, description): Varsity Parlimentary Debate (4 yrs), Jazz Sax (4 yrs), Op-ed writer (4 yrs), Theatre (2 yrs), Math Club (3 yrs), and about 3-4 other things that I'm a bit too lazy to list
Job/Work Experience: Android App Dev Intern at a small tech startup (11/12th summer), IT Intern at a relatively big-name video game company (10th/11th summer). Both were unpaid tbh.
Volunteer/Community service: nada.
Summer Activities: internships. other than that, i just **** around and read.
Essays: Common App essay was about how I turned my rather boring summer internship in 10th grade into a learning experience, and the supplement was a straightforward, yet thorough, take on the typical ""why"" essay. Although I cannot objectively rank my essays, I thought I did very well on both.
Teacher Rec #1: Haven't read, though I'd imagine it's unique. My English teacher from last year thought I was exceptionally bright but very, very lazy.
Teacher Rec #2: Haven't read, though I'd imagine it's flattering. I'm really close to my CS teacher, so I bet he put in a good word for me (though he's not as strong of a writer as is the writer of rec 1).
Counselor Rec: Haven't read, but I'd imagine it's rather generic.
Additional Rec: nope.
Interview: nah.
Additional material (abstracts/papers/other): nope. probably should've sent them code or something tbh.

[ b]Reflection:[ /b]
Strengths: According to teachers, I'm supposedly a strong writer, even for a prep school grad. EC's are varied, job experiences are specialized.
What you tried to focus on in your application - any hooks you tried to make for yourself: dunno. I think I tried to show how I have a considerable amount of hands-on technical knowledge in CS, in addition to the expected high-level theoretical knowledge (as evidenced by my independent study). Additionally, My supplement got pretty detailed with classes, professors, and potential research opportunities, showing my specific interests within the larger field. Ultimately, I just tried to seem like a knowledgeable, well-rounded CS major.
Weaknesses: Mediocre grades, 0 dedicated interest, no interview (I feel that I interview well)
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: In addition to the typical weaknesses, I don't think I'm a particularly great fit for the cutthroat, hyper-competitive pre-med/science/engineering orgyfest that is JHU.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected:
Accepted at NYU, UMich

Job/Work Experience:
Volunteer/Community service:
Created a penpal program to connect disadvantaged students in my ethnic homeland with students at my school.
Volunteered as a peer mentor to a girl living in the aforementioned homeland
Summer Activities:
Internship at arguably the best cancer institute in the US. Did research, co-author on abstract. Pretty cool experience.
Essays (rating 1-10, details): Common App: 8/10. Idk, it was well written, but I wasn't a huge fan of it. It was almost too deep haha. I wrote about my cultural identity, and how I want to build bridges (metaphorically, of course - I ain't no engineer ).
Supplement: 8-9/10 Cute essay, but tbh I spent like half of it telling a cute story about myself [used this as the skeleton for a few different schools' essays]  I only really mentioned two specific things about JHU (research & the major I want to do). Most of it was about me, research I've done, and my love for advocacy.
Counselor: 7/10 just because I have no idea
English teacher: 9/10 she told me it was very very strong
History teacher: at least 7-8/10, but I'm not really sure
Interview: Didn't get one
Applied for Financial Aid?: Well, I hit yes on common app, but then never turned anything other than FAFSA in, so...
Intended Major: International Studies/Public Health Studies
State (if domestic applicant): PA
Country (if international applicant):
School Type: Private
Ethnicity: South Asian
Gender: Female
Income Bracket: >200k (I'm not getting any need based fin aid)
Hooks (URM, first generation college, etc): None
Reflection: Yesterday, I would've sworn that I didn't actually wanna go to JHU... now that I've been accepted, I'm totaly reconsidering. I'm excited to visit sometime soon  Not sure about actually going though, because I'm thinking pre-med, and I know pre-med is insane at JHU.
Strengths: SAT (although in this thread, it looks like I'm relatively low lol), rank, course load rigor
Weaknesses: Common App Essay? I'm not really sure. Subject tests could have been better. Lol is being Asian a weakness?
Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected:No clue, honestly. I'm just thankful, especially after my Duke rejection yesterday 
Where else were you accepted/deferred/rejected:
Accepted: Swarthmore, Vanderbilt, Temple, Rutgers, NJIT, Drexel, Northeastern
Deferred: Yale

General Comments:
Like I said before, this website is absolute evil. It makes you compare yourself to others, lowers your self-esteem and honestly makes life a little bit (A LOT) crappier. But hey, I spent wayyyyyy to much time on this website so I would feel guilty if didn’t post. So because I am compromising my principles by posting on this website, I feel like I should share the immense amount of wisdom I have gained over the past couple of months. Instead of trying to analyze my stats and figure out how the hell I got in, here are some things to take away from this is: 1) Do not compare yourself or try to copy others. It is human nature but try to remember that everyone is unique 2) please don’t try to look for some pattern on these stat threads. Trust me. I tried, I failed, don’t waste your time. 3) You may think that some people on this website who are rejected/accepted are gods who can walk on water but...dramatic pause… it is all an illusion (GASP). What you see on these stats are people in their best light with all their flaws excluded. I mean looking now at my stats, I am quite impressed but if you met me in person, haha, that would be a different story 4) You probably won’t believe me now but no matter how good the acceptance feels or how **** that rejection feels, you won’t remember it a couple months down the road. You WILL end up in a place that is right for you, a place that will make you happy. So even though you may think I am just spouting out a bunch of ****, all I ask for is to give me the benefit of the doubt.
Wow that was a lot. If you made it to the end, AWESOME! I hope I was able to enlighten you. So, in summation, be yourself, like the number pi there is no pattern, unlike what you may see on this website none of us are perfect, give me the benefit of the doubt and in the words of Stanley Fich, have fun, be safe, and party hard.

-Summer Activities: Well I slept a lot so
-Essays:
Hopkins: 10/10, I think I was possessed when I wrote it
CommonApp: 10/10, answered the prompt about a place you're most comfortable
(I promise I'm not just giving 10/10s, Hopkins definitely got the best of my essays, they were awesome)
-Teacher Recommendations: One I read and was amazing, came from my sophomore english teacher who's also my Key Club advisor. Second one I didn't read, came from my AP Chem teacher who I've heard writes awesome recs though.
-Counselor Rec:I filled out a brag sheet and talked to my counselor about what I was active in but she didn't know me well (400 kids in the grade she oversees), and she has pretty bad grammar, so probably average/slightly below average.

Strengths: I really don't know but probably the Essays, subject tests, and maybe rec letters?
Weaknesses: Counselor rec most likely, but I'm sure they're used to getting bad ones from big public schools
Why you think you were accepted: Highlighted three things: passion for service, science, and travel throughout all aspects of application. It was obvious I wasn't just saying stuff for the apps. I'd taken the hardest sciences possible at my school every year, been involved i service heavily since middle school, wrote about traveling in essays (my common app essay for the ""comfortable place"" was about airports).
Where else you are applying or have already applied: UF (full ride AH), UChicago (waitlisted, just like apparently everyone), UPenn, Columbia, Harvard, Yale.
General Comments/Advice/Hindsight: Highlight your strengths as much as you can without being repetitive. Transcripts and ranks seem to matter more here (just going off past year's admissions profiles) than in some other colleges, though obviously it's still VERY hollistic. They only have one supplement essay- make it good, and really personalize it for Hopkins, not just where you can change the name to another college.
Don't be afraid to show your personality. You need to set yourself apart, and since no two personalities are alike, that's an awesome way to do it. ",JHU,2019

Strengths: I think that my EC's were very strong as well as my grades. I've consistently maintained a 4.0 UW GPA throughout high school. As well, I think that my passion (don't use this word in your essays  ) for helping people really shone through in my essays as well as my curiosity for learning! 
Weaknesses: Could it be any more obvious? My SAT score (achem CR cough cough). I'm an INTERNATIONAL ASIAN FEMALE. I repeat, an INTERNATIONAL ASIAN FEMALE (WITH A LOW SAT SCORE). LIKE WHAT IS LIFE. I admit I never studied particularly hard for the SAT's, which is something I regret a bit because I know I could have gotten 2250+. But I think my high score in the Math section of the SAT as well my high scores in my Math II and Bio M SAT II scores really showed off my area of expertise.
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: It just goes to show how extremely random the entire admit process is, though I couldn't be any happier! 
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected:

Accepted: Johns Hopkins University (JHU), Duke University, UCLA, UCSD, Waitlisted: UChicago, Berkeley, Rejected: Northwestern, Still waiting for them ivies!General Comments: PEOPLE: YOUR SAT SCORES DO NOT DEFINE YOU AND THEY ARE NOT EVERYTHING. However, it's definitely true that the higher your scores are, the better. I thought my chances of getting in were very very low (intl students uhhh 5% acceptance rate maybe?) since most asians who apply have stellar SAT reasoning scores and especially since this year's applicant pool was the ""strongest in the university's history""). I thought my CR score would bring me down but it didn't! I'm still a bit confused as to how I got into both Duke and JHU but waitlisted from Berkeley ... But nevertheless, I'm super happy! All those applying to JHU in the future: Have really strong EC's with leadership positions and maintain a high GPA (you don't have to have a 4.0 GPA but work hard!), make your essays stellar (some people worked on them from like 4 months but I wrote mine in a day and then spent less than a week editing them), and show them that you will contribute to the JHU community!!!  The adcom seems also to be super into people who show that they have a true curiosity for learning (aka people who are inquirers) so definitely factor that into your essays. Good luck guys! GO BLUE JAYS GO!

[/list]General Comments:  JHU was much more selective this cycle compared to previous years, and I'm ecstatic to have been accepted. JHU was the first school I was really interested in at the beginning of this process, and I'm pumped that my dream came true. With that being said, it's still a bit of a crapshoot, and I am so grateful for this opportunity and that I happened to have something they were looking for this year. Though I'm still waiting on a few schools, it is likely I'll be a blue jay in the fall, and I'm very excited! Congrats to those accepted,and to those rejected or waitlisted, don't be discouraged, everything happens for a reason and you will end up somewhere absolutely wonderful for you, whether it's JHU or not. Though I'm posting this, I do agree with @evilisnear9‌ and their sentiment that this website, though albeit sometimes helpful, can be detrimental and cause an excessive amount of stress. Comparing yourself to others will not give a better idea of your chances, really. This process is all about perspective, which can be easily lost along the way. With these schools, all you can really do is put your all into your apps and try your best and hope it works out. ",JHU,2019

[*] SAT I: single/only sitting: 2330 --> 800 M, 780 W, 750 CR --> My advice for future applicants: I earned these scores by just taking the SAT practice tests in the SAT Big Blue Book, and, OK I admit this, the only really boring part was I did buy one of those ""500 SAT vocabulary words"" recommended on Amazon and worked through it. Please don't feel pressured to pay anyone for SAT preparation/tutoring/classes, etc. They are costly and there are so many books in most local libraries that offer the same information, just be disciplined. You can identify what are your strengths and weaknesses by taking the multitude of tests in that Big Blue Book to see patterns/areas to work through, and save your $$ by not giving it to the supposed experts.

I hope someone sees this and thinks to themselves that maybe they do have a chance at getting into JHU. I was so surprised when I received my decision! One girl from my school got into JHU last year but is majoring in stats; she had a higher class rank than me, higher SAT scores than me, and she was involved in a lot of extra-curriculars. When she got in, she showed me that where I come from doesn't determine how far I can go in life. The best thing I did for myself this year was ignoring everything that my family and friends said and applying here to my dream school!

Why you think you were accepted/deferred/rejected: I have literally zero idea. I was accepted off the waitlist today, and I thought that I would never get even a decision back! But, it happened, and I'm still in shock.

Accepted to: GWU, King's College London, University of St. Andrews, University of Edinburgh, American University, JHU
General Comments/Advice/Hindsight: The essay is extremely powerful in the application. Make sure to get good enough stats (perfect scores and grades are not necessary) for the school, write a great essay, demonstrate passion in something (I loved what I did in my NGO), and build strong positive relationships with your teachers. I updated my JHU profile with some new things I had been doing, as well as a letter of interest. For the letter, I think that you need to be really specific in why you want to go to JHU. Don't write something generic like ""JHU is has a lot of resources"" or ""the campus is really nice"" or something. And seriously, if you don't know why you like JHU, why did you apply in the first place? So that's my biggest tip from a waitlist person.
The waitlist is pretty much a lottery game. I got in probably because someone similar to me decided to not attend. With the acceptance rate of the JHU waitlist a little less than 2% (according to College Kickstart), don't count on getting in. Find another great school that you love. I'm going to King's College London, even though I decided to stay on the waitlist. Hang in there for those who are still waiting! You will find and love the school that will love you too. ",JHU,2019

Hi - Congrats on getting into JHU. I noticed that you're from Colorado and also graduated from an IB program. I'm a parent of a 7th grader in Denver and we're considering an IB program.

Essays: I thought they were pretty good, but who am I to judge. My JHU one was very specific and I thought it conveyed how much I wanted to go to the school pretty well.
Teacher Recommendation: Alright? I'm not so sure on this one. I'm not very outgoing amongst my teachers nor do I get super good grades so there's not much for them to gush about. I actually asked my math teacher of two years for a rec even though I struggled greatly in her class. She probably wrote about me overcoming my struggle in her class, but that might have possibly backfired by making me sound like a bad student. My Spanish teacher wrote my other one.
Counselor Rec: Alright, public school with only a few counselors so I don't know how much effort was spent on it cuz he has to write a loooott and we don't get to know our counselors very well.

Reflection
Strengths: SAT score, essays, senior year course load, that's about it...
Weaknesses: bad GPA especially in freshman year (lots of Bs), not many extracurricular activities, lack of major awards/special distinctive qualities that you can list on paper
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: There's nothing very special about me that makes me stand out on paper. I don't have a lot of extracurricular and I'm not in any clubs. There were a few more small extracurriculars I probably should have added to my activities list on Commonapp, but I thought I shouldn't cuz they didn't seem that important. I kind of regret that now because at least it would have made it look like I do more stuff, but oh well it probably wouldn't have made a difference in the end. Also my grades suck. Plus I'm Chinese which kind of voids my SAT score which is the only redeeming part of my application.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: don't know yet. But I'm really hoping to get into USC!
General Comments:  I'm mostly disappointed because now I have to do all my other applications...Winter break is not gonna be fun. I was really hoping to get in but I also was expecting rejection. To all other rejectees, this is just the way things were supposed to go! If we didn't get into JHU, there's a reason for that. I'm sure that wherever you end up you will be happy because it's not the college that makes your life, it's yourself! Good luck to everyone else. ",JHU,2018

The Hopkins essay was a real pain for me. I love Hopkins (obviously) and I wanted to show it but I am undecided and I felt as though the question was kind of major/interest-based, so I talked about the lack of a core-curriculum and how that appealed to me. Honestly, I wasn't very happy with this essay but I think my common app essay was decent.

***********NOTE TO THOSE READING THIS*************
I spent a good portion of my life on CC these past two years. Threads like this don't tell you anything. Hopkins is really a holistic school. There are people with impeccable stats that don't get in, and kids who surprise. No one knows what goes on behind those doors. Unless an ad com tells you ""you have a good chance hint hint wink wink nudge nudge"" take all the chances and results threads with a grain of salt. Here's some advice for what will help you:
- Do well in school: Take the most rigorous classes, do well in them
- Be a leader
- BE PASSIONATE: Do stuff because it interests you, not because ""it looks good on apps""
- FOLLOW THOSE PASSIONS

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected:I really have no idea. It would be cool if we knew what admissions counselors are thinking while they're reviewing our applications. I think they liked how I am well-rounded and passionate about a lot of unique things.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I was accepted into University of Pittsburgh Honors College earlier this year (they have rolling admissions- I applied before I even decided I was applying to JHU early decision)
General Comments:
#1)To all future applicants reading this: If JHU is your absolute-number one-I BELONG HERE-school-of-your-dreams, definitely apply early decision! If you aren't sure about whether or not you're completely in love with Hopkins, do an overnight stay (they're usually offered to seniors in the fall). Staying overnight made me realize that Hopkins was absolutely the right choice and I knew that I wanted to apply ED. Good Luck with your applications!!!

Summer Activities: see above
Essays: In my opinion and my college counselor's opinion, they were pretty good. My JHU one was actually written in the format of a play about a surgery I witnessed at Johns Hopkins to represent my combined passions for art and science. My common app one was about a realization I had on a rooftop in my real hometown, Karachi, in Pakistan.
Teacher Recommendation: From my English teacher in 11th grade and Honors Pre-Calc teacher in 11th grade; they both told me voluntarily and pretty excitedly that they wrote me really good recs
Counselor Rec: apparently very good
Additional Rec: not allowed by JHU
Interview: excellent. My interviewer also admitted to me that he was gay once I told him I was involved in diversity clubs, particularly gay-straight alliance, and we bonded A LOT, so my advice is, if you speak passionately about things you're involved in outside the classroom, you're definitely going to strike a chord with your interviewer.

Weaknesses: probably that i don't have a lot of math-related stuff considering I applied pre-med to hopkins but then again they clearly appreciate the artist-meets-science-nerd life otherwise i wouldn't have been accepted
Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I have a very strong, passionate voice through my essays and my extra-curriculars/work experience/ volunteer experience -- my interests in writing and science are immediately and very clear and correlate with the tentative majors I put down of CogSci and English. In other words, my personal identity stood out very clearly on paper and probably seemed appealing to them.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: Accepted to Georgetown University
General Comments: Getting into college is not a science, but an art. If you express yourself (which is a form of art in itself) in the best, most candid way you can, you'll get in wherever you set your heart on. JHU was not my first choice, and I was forced to ED here by my parents, but I'm damn well glad I got in and I know that I enjoy being on campus and it's a great place for me because not only are they good at medicine but also philosophy and english type stuff too (surprisingly).

Firstly, thanks for making this thread.
I am on edge, especially after hearing about my friends' decision results for their ED/EA schools. Even if I am fortunate enough to get accepted, the wait for a BME decision (by snail mail of all things) will be torturous. ",JHU,2017

Something about me- Talked about my hatred for soup but used it to tell more about my personality. I feel as if my voice came across well

Why you think you were accepted/waitlisted/rejected: I was able to show the kind of person I would be on campus through my essays. My recommendations were likely very strong as well because I had close bonds with all my recommenders.
Where else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: n/a
General Comments: I literally had resigned myself to being rejected (since Hopkins barely defers people). My heart goes out all those who were rejected. I was feeling that way until I got my decision. It might be hard to see right now, but Hopkins doesn't deserve you; you are destined for great places 
Lastly, my advice for those applying for RD or next year: Make sure your entire application is strong, especially your essays. Let your personality shine through your essays because, ultimately, all any University wants are likable people who they know will contribute to the positive atmosphere at any institution. Test scores aren't the end of the world; I'm proof of that

Essays: I thought they were pretty good. I focused one of them on my special interests/talents, one of them on why Hopkins would be great for me as someone who loves History, and one focusing on my personal life (family loss) and how it has affected me academically.
Teacher Recommendation: Very good for both teacher recommendations. I also received another recommendation letter from my NYU professor, which was also quite good.
Counselor Rec: Fantastic. I am very close with him.
Additional Rec: N/A
Interview: I thought it went rather well, although I believe that the interviews are inconsequential.

Job/Work Experience: Tutoring
Volunteer/Community service: Tutoring in a camp, live-in service, orphanage visits.
Summer Activities: See above.
Essays: Probably good? I don't know - essay evaluations are so subjective. Had multiple people look over my essays, though, and I think my reason for choosing BME (first essay) is pretty solid. My second essay (""Tell us something about yourself"") uses a pretty risky/creative format and I guess it worked! Common App is more of an honest recount/reflection of my tutoring experience. The main thing with essays is to make your topic sound interesting and unique, I guess. Use your entire imagination

General Comments:
This college application process was a long, painful road for me, and had I had the chance to do it all over again, I would have done *many* things differently. My advice:
1. Don't shy away from things. Try new ECs or electives! You don't have to be in a million clubs or have an unmanageable workload, but don't let nervousness or an inferiority complex stop you. Also, don't shy away from leadership positions if you are already passionate about or committed to an EC.
2. Think about college early. I'm still mad that my high school said nothing about colleges or the application process until my senior year... :mad: CC shouldn't be flooded with pre-high-schoolers, but little by little, start researching colleges, take a look at some academic areas you're interested in, and get familiar with the things you will have to do to apply, particularly in your junior and senior years. I feel really dumb about this now, but I didn't start thinking about college until the summer between my junior and senior years . I didn't know about any other colleges besides Harvard, Yale, Brown, MIT, and JHU because I live in such a Tiger-Mom-Parent kind of household; it's a good thing I had some people telling me to apply to more schools!
3. If you are a super-super-super bad writer like I am, start those essays early (earlier than September of senior year like I did, especially for any early apps). They're about you, but it's harder than it looks. Do some soul-searching about who you are and why you do things, and research the kinds of essay prompts you'll be facing early. I didn't even know that college applications required essays or interviews, which led to a lot of regret later on.
4. Don't read this and think, ""Wow. This girl must be so much smarter, more talented, more beautiful than me (;))... I'll never get in..."" Even with the things I had going for me, no way in a million years did I think I would get accepted. Don't be discouraged from applying based on other people's scenarios, because every case will be unique.
All that being said, JHU was not my first choice, but in the end, I'm happy with my decision to go here. I think it will teach me a lot, and not just academics. Congrats to my fellow Blue Jays, and good luck to all prospective students! ",JHU,2017

While they do, I'd be more worried about whether or not you could do well in the intensive BME program. Your other acceptances and rejections will likely give you a more accurate picture.

General Comments: I know, I applied to a lot of schools. It's just that I'm international, and it's super hard for me to get into top US schools, coming from China. Got to hedge my bets. Applied to schools outside US too. My high school is super hard (it deflates grades and offers few APs) and has no reputation at all. I think it hurt my chances at other schools. Again, I applied to top schools that are super hard to get into. College admissions is random, I guess. Bummed out that I didn't get into any Ivy League Schools. But who cares? I got Johns Hopkins!

is the isis website just for financial aid applicants? ",JHU,2016
391,"
I actually have an estimated $0 in aid right now... I waited to send in the IDOC forms (signed 2011 income tax form) until AFTER I was accepted to the colleges I applied to. Only Johns Hopkins asked for them though; I hope and pray to God that they give me financial aid! ",JHU,2016
392,"
Hopkins seemed remarkably strong this year, or has this always been the case?
I got into Dartmouth, Brown, UPenn, Yale, Duke, Berkeley, Northwestern, Tufts, and waitlisted at some other top schools but the only rejection I got was from Hopkins.
At first, I dismissed this as a form of protecting their yield (I had never looked into the school and really just applied as a whim), but damn are most of you above strong. ",JHU,2016

Is the Isis website just for financial aid applicants? Because I received my acceptance yesterday, but do not have a login to that website ",JHU,2016
394,"
I'm not too sure about Isis. I definitely had never heard anything about it before yesterday even though I applied for financial aid, so I don't have a password. When I tried to sign in as a new member, it said I was too late and have to wait and call the financial aid office or something. I'm hoping the financial aid package is sent in the mail with the admission letter and merit aid package so I don't have to worry about Isis at all. ",JHU,2016

General Comments:
So way back in November or October I made a list of all the interview deadlines/dates for my schools and I sent an email to schedule my JHU interview then. I forgot about it, and later on, buried under lots of apps, decided not to apply to JHU. Then, my interviewer emailed me with a little blurb about herself and after looking her up on linked in and discovering that she had majored in the two things I wanted to major in and also played flute and also danced, etc., I pretty much decided to apply just so I could interview with her ahahah. The only problem being that this was after Jan 01, however JHU has a policy where they allow you to apply between Jan 1-15 if you had previously added JHU to your Common App and then deleted it. So I applied during the window, rushed around getting the paperwork fixed because once you delete a school from CommonApp, the stuff already sent there (teacher recs) gets deleted too, if you use Naviance/eDocs. Anyway, so basically my application was a last minute, I won't get in anyway type thing, and lo and behold I somehow got in!  And as of now, since they gave me a huge grant, JHU is my front runner for college choices. Woo! ",JHU,2016

It's apparent that the folks who were rejected aren't posting in this thread, yet I've seen some of them floating around in the other parts of this forum. A similar misrepresentation is happening on the Stanford forum. Ironically, it'll probably give false hope to next year's crop.
Another trend I'm seeing is applicants with average to low GPAs getting accepted to JHU. I think that's going to change with next year's dean of admissions from Penn. Should he adopt Penn's model, high schoolers with poor GPAs will have a much harder time. I'd have to agree with this approach. JHU, Princeton, MIT and Stanford are about the only schools who ignore freshman year grades. I don't think this should be the case. Those who have worked hard all four years should be rewarded as such. ",JHU,2016
407,"
Blah,
I didn't do quite as well freshman year as I did my last 3 (especially last 2) years. There is a huge difference from being 14 and being 18. While I don't think freshman year should be discounted entirely, I think it should be looked at as part of the picture. Weighing a student's first semester senior year grades the same as their first semester freshman year grades would probably not be a good idea. That said, I do think that the trend of low GPA outliers getting into Hopkins will probably end, and I do think a push towards a more ""by the numbers"" approach is warranted. Higher GPA's and test scores are one of the best predictors for college (academic) success. ",JHU,2016
408,"
^I would also agree with a decreased emphasis on freshman year grades. I believe the upper year AP course grades should hold more weight than freshman year as they potentially are more in line with college courses in terms of difficulty. I just don't think discounting freshman year grades entirely is in anyone's best interest. While unintended, it might give students the impression that freshman year is not important or that they can slack off a bit and pick up the slack later. Additionally, it can punish those who worked hard all four years as one of their years is essentially discounted. ",JHU,2016
409,"
On the other side, DS1 was accepted with a 3.62 high school GPA. He graduated JHU with a 3.94 GPA. Perhaps the admissions committee knows what they are doing. ",JHU,2016
410,"
The argument that discounting freshman grades is a punishment to people who worked hard all 4 years is ridiculous, in my opinion. If you did well all 4 years, it shouldn't matter which years they count because your GPA will be high no matter what. Surely it's better to have an upward trend than a downward trend, and what discounting freshman grades does is helps those with upward trends, doesn't affect those with unchanging grades, and hurts those with downward trends.
I also don't think grades should matter when you're so young because lots of 13-year-olds only get good grades because of the way they were raised. Classes don't challenge you the same in 9th in 12th grades, you make far fewer choices for yourself in 9th grade than in 12th, and your brain has literally not fully developed yet because you are still a child! In the same way that studies show no difference in future success between kids with 120-140 IQ and kids with genius IQ, I think there is little correlation between how well you do in 9th grade (provided that you are still average or above) and the rest of your life (and the only reason the correlation isn't weaker is that society sees the kids getting As in 9th grade as being successful and then puts more effort into them, puts them in higher level classes, etc.).
Blah2009 mentioned that JHU, Princeton, MIT and Stanford are the only schools that discount freshman grades. I think this fact supports the discounting of freshman grades because if 4 of the best schools in the world are doing it, obviously it's proven to be at least a little bit effective! As a big fan of MIT, I'm willing to assume that they would not be discounting freshman grades if their own research into the matter didn't support it. ",JHU,2016

I also forgot you only applied to Hopkins and your state school, right?...I'm sure you did *wink* ",JHU,2016

Tried to PM you explain the situation, but you're box is full. To put it simply and shortly, there are 3 of us who made the account (just today) to try to get some perspective, only, on our college questions. I just thought to post this really quick so people with test anxiety can have hope for institutions like these. Sorry for the confusion. ",JHU,2016

NOTE to future applicants:
As Blah has said, please take these posts with a grain of salt. For a good perspective on where you stand, consult the middle 50% on the admissions website for scores, and if possible Naviance for past admits from your school. Those will give you a realistic idea of what to expect.
The average SAT for the class of 2016 was a 1450 which is about a 32-33 ACT. GPA wise I'm not sure, but again probably a 3.7+ unweighted average with a rigorous course load and commiserate extracurriculars / accomplishments. ",JHU,2016

General Comments:
I am pleased to be going to Brown University in the Fall of 2012.
There seems to be quite a bit of randomness in the evaluation process at schools where the acceptance rates are very low.
I took all of the application essays very seriously because my lowest SAT score was in writing. Brown's app was the one with the most essays which might be why Brown was the only Ivy (out of the seven that I applied to) that accepted me.
